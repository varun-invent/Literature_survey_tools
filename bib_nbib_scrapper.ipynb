      "Title:  Atypical cross talk between mentalizing and mirror neuron networks in autismspectrum disorder.\n",
      "Abstract:  IMPORTANCE: Converging evidence indicates that brain abnormalities in autismspectrum disorder (ASD) involve atypical network connectivity, but it is unclearwhether altered connectivity is especially prominent in brain networks thatparticipate in social cognition. OBJECTIVE: To investigate whether adolescentswith ASD show altered functional connectivity in 2 brain networks putativelyimpaired in ASD and involved in social processing, theory of mind (ToM) andmirror neuron system (MNS). DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Cross_sectionalstudy using resting_state functional magnetic resonance imaging involving 25adolescents with ASD between the ages of 11 and 18 years and 25 typicallydeveloping adolescents matched for age, handedness, and nonverbal IQ. MAINOUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Statistical parametric maps testing the degree ofwhole_brain functional connectivity and social functioning measures. RESULTS:Relative to typically developing controls, participants with ASD showed a mixedand underconnectivity in the ToM network, which wasassociated with greater social impairment. Increased connectivity in the ASDgroup was detected primarily between the regions of the MNS and ToM, and wascorrelated with sociocommunicative measures, suggesting that excessive ToM_MNScross talk might be associated with social impairment. In a secondary analysiscomparing a subset of the 15 participants with ASD with the most severesymptomology and a tightly matched subset of 15 typically developing controls,participants with ASD showed exclusive overconnectivity effects in both ToM andMNS networks, which were also associated with greater social dysfunction.CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Adolescents with ASD showed atypically increasedfunctional connectivity involving the mentalizing and mirror neuron systems,largely reflecting greater cross talk between the 2. This finding is consistentwith emerging evidence of reduced network segregation in ASD and challenges theprevailing theory of general long_distance underconnectivity in ASD. This excessToM_MNS connectivity may reflect immature or aberrant developmental processes in2 brain networks involved in understanding of others, a domain of impairment inASD. Further, robust links with sociocommunicative symptoms of ASD implicateatypically increased ToM_MNS connectivity in social deficits observed in ASD.\n",
      "Title:  Altered network topologies and hub organization in adults with autism: aresting_state fMRI study.\n",
      "Abstract:  Recent functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) studies on autism spectrumcondition (ASC) have identified dysfunctions in specific brain networks involvedin social and non_social cognition that persist into adulthood. Althoughincreasing numbers of fMRI studies have revealed atypical functional connectivityin the adult ASC brain, such functional alterations at the network level have notyet been fully characterized within the recently developed graph_theoreticalframework. Here, we applied a graph_theoretical analysis to resting_state fMRIand gender_matched controls, toinvestigate the topological properties and organization of autistic brainnetwork. Analyses of global metrics revealed that, relative to the controls,participants with ASC exhibited significant decreases in clustering coefficientand characteristic path length, indicating a shift towards randomizedorganization. Furthermore, analyses of local metrics revealed a significantlyaltered organization of the hub nodes in ASC, as shown by analyses of hubdisruption indices using multiple local metrics and by a loss of \"hubness\" inseveral nodes (e.g., the bilateral superior temporal sulcus, right dorsolateralprefrontal cortex, and precuneus) that are critical for social and non_socialcognitive functions. In particular, local metrics of the anterior cingulatecortex consistently showed significant negative correlations with theAutism_Spectrum Quotient score. Our results demonstrate altered patterns ofglobal and local topological properties that may underlie impaired social andnon_social cognition in ASC.\n",
      "Title:  ASD: Psychopharmacologic Treatments and Neurophysiologic Underpinnings.\n",
      "Abstract:  Autism Spectrum Disorder encompasses a range of neurodevelopmental disorderscharacterized by early deficits in social communication in addition to restrictedand repetitive behaviors. Symptoms are increasingly understood to be associatedwith abnormalities in the coordination of neuronal assemblies responsible forprocessing information essential for early adaptive behaviors. Pharmacologictreatments carry evidence for clinically significant benefit of multipleimpairing symptoms of ASD, yet these benefits are limited and range across abroad spectrum of medication classes, making it difficult to characterizeassociated neurochemical impairments. Increasing prevalence of both ASD and itspharmacologic management calls for greater understanding of the neurophysiologicbasis of the disorder. This paper reviews underlying alterations in local brainregions and coordination of brain activation patterns during both resting stateand task_related processes. We propose that new pharmacologic treatments mayfocus on realigning trajectories of network specialization across development byworking in combination with behavioral treatments to enhance social and emotionallearning by bolstering the impact of experience_induced plasticity on neuronalnetwork connectivity.\n",
      "Title:  Altered functional connectivity of the language network in ASD: role of classicallanguage areas and cerebellum.\n",
      "Abstract:  The development of language, social interaction and communicative skills isremarkably different in the child with autism spectrum disorder (ASD). Atypicalbrain connectivity has frequently been reported in this patient population.However, the neural correlates underlying their disrupted language developmentand functioning are still poorly understood. Using resting state fMRI, weinvestigated the functional connectivity properties of the language network in agroup of ASD patients with clear comorbid language impairment (ASD_LI; N = 19)and compared them to the language related connectivity properties of 23age_matched typically developing children. A verb generation task was used todetermine language components commonly active in both groups. Eight jointlanguage components were identified and subsequently used as seeds in a restingstate analysis. Interestingly, both the interregional and the seed_based wholebrain connectivity analysis showed preserved connectivity between the classicalintrahemispheric language centers, Wernicke's and Broca's areas. In contrasthowever, a marked loss of functional connectivity was found between the rightcerebellar region and the supratentorial regulatory language areas. Also, theconnectivity between the interhemispheric Broca regions and modulatory controldorsolateral prefrontal region was found to be decreased. This disruption ofnormal modulatory control and automation function by the cerebellum may underliethe abnormal language function in children with ASD_LI.\n",
      "Title:  Structural and functional rich club organization of the brain in children andadults.\n",
      "Abstract:  Recent studies using Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) have proposed that thebrain's white matter is organized as a rich club, whereby the most highlyconnected regions of the brain are also highly connected to each other. Here weuse both functional and diffusion_weighted MRI in the human brain to investigatewhether the rich club phenomena is present with functional connectivity, and howthis organization relates to the structural phenomena. We also examine whetherrich club regions serve to integrate information between distinct brain systems,and conclude with a brief investigation of the developmental trajectory ofrich_club phenomena. In agreement with prior work, both adults and childrenshowed robust structural rich club organization, comprising regions of thesuperior medial frontal/dACC, medial parietal/PCC, insula, and inferior temporalcortex. We also show that these regions were highly integrated across the brain'smajor networks. Functional brain networks were found to have rich club phenomenain a similar spatial layout, but a high level of segregation between systems.While no significant differences between adults and children were foundstructurally, adults showed significantly greater functional rich cluborganization. This difference appeared to be driven by a specific set ofconnections between superior parietal, insula, and supramarginal cortex. In sum,this work highlights the existence of both a structural and functional rich clubin adult and child populations with some functional changes over development. Italso offers a potential target in examining atypical network organization incommon developmental brain disorders, such as ADHD and Autism.\n",

      "Abstract:  BACKGROUND: Lateralization of brain structure and function occurs in typicaldevelopment, and abnormal lateralization is present in various neuropsychiatricdisorders. Autism is characterized by a lack of left lateralization in structureand function of regions involved in language, such as Broca and Wernicke areas.METHODS: Using functional connectivity magnetic resonance imaging from a largepublicly available sample (n = 964), we tested whether abnormal functionallateralization in autism exists preferentially in language regions or in a morediffuse pattern across networks of lateralized brain regions. RESULTS: The autismgroup exhibited significantly reduced left lateralization in a few connectionsinvolving language regions and regions from the default mode network, but resultsand right_lateralized networks. There is atrend that suggests the lack of left lateralization in a connection involvingWernicke area and the posterior cingulate cortex associates with more severeautism. CONCLUSIONS: Abnormal language lateralization in autism may be due toabnormal language development rather than to a deficit in hemisphericspecialization of the entire brain.\n",
      "Title:  The implications of brain connectivity in the neuropsychology of autism.\n",
      "Abstract:  Autism is a neurodevelopmental disorder that has been associated with atypicalbrain functioning. Functional connectivity MRI (fcMRI) studies examining neuralnetworks in autism have seen an exponential rise over the last decade. Suchinvestigations have led to the characterization of autism as a distributed neuralsystems disorder. Studies have found widespread cortical underconnectivity, localoverconnectivity, and mixed results suggesting disrupted brain connectivity as apotential neural signature of autism. In this review, we summarize the findingsof previous fcMRI studies in autism with a detailed examination of theirmethodology, in order to better understand its potential and to delineate thepitfalls. We also address how a multimodal neuroimaging approach (incorporatingdifferent measures of brain connectivity) may help characterize the complexneurobiology of autism at a global level. Finally, we also address the potentialof neuroimaging_based markers in assisting neuropsychological assessment ofautism. The quest for a neural marker for autism is still ongoing, yet newfindings suggest that aberrant brain connectivity may be a promising candidate.\n",
      "Title:  Autistic traits modulate frontostriatal connectivity during processing ofrewarding faces.\n",
      "Abstract:  Deficits in facial mimicry have been widely reported in autism. Some studies havesuggested that these deficits are restricted to spontaneous mimicry and do notextend to volitional mimicry. We bridge these apparently inconsistentobservations by testing the impact of reward value on neural indices of mimicryand how autistic traits modulate this impact. Neutral faces were conditioned withhigh and low reward. Subsequently, functional connectivity between the ventralstriatum (VS) and inferior frontal gyrus (IFG) was measured while neurotypicaladults (n = 30) watched happy expressions made by these conditioned faces. Wefound greater VS_IFG connectivity in response to high reward vs low reward happyfaces. This difference was negatively proportional to autistic traits, suggestingthat reduced spontaneous mimicry of social stimuli seen in autism, may be relatedto a failure in the modulation of the mirror system by the reward system ratherthan a circumscribed deficit in the mirror system.\n",
      "Title:  Impact of methodological variables on functional connectivity findings in autismspectrum disorders.\n",
      "Abstract:  Growing evidence suggests that Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) involvesabnormalities of multiple functional networks. Neuroimaging studies of ASD havetherefore increasingly focused on connectivity. Many functional connectivity(fcMRI) studies have reported network underconnectivity in children and adultswith ASD. However, there are notable inconsistencies, with some studies reportingoverconnectivity. A previous literature survey suggested that a fewmethodological factors play a crucial role in differential fcMRI outcomes. Usingthree ASD data sets (two task_related, one resting state) from 54 ASD and 51typically developing (TD) participants (ages 9_18 years), we examined the impactof four methodological factors: type of pipeline (co_activation vs. intrinsicanalysis, related to temporal filtering and removal of task_related effects),seed selection, field of view (whole brain vs. limited ROIs), and dataset.Significant effects were found for type of pipeline, field of view, and dataset.Notably, for each dataset results ranging from robust underconnectivity to robustoverconnectivity were detected, depending on the type of pipeline, with intrinsicfcMRI analyses (low bandpass filter and task regressor) predominantly yieldingoverconnectivity in ASD, but co_activation analyses (no low bandpass filter ortask removal) mostly generating underconnectivity findings. These results suggestthat methodological variables have dramatic impact on group differences reportedin fcMRI studies. Improved awareness of their implications appears indispensiblein fcMRI studies when inferences about \"underconnectivity\" or \"overconnectivity\"in ASD are made. In the absence of a gold standard for functional connectivity,the combination of different methodological approaches promises a morecomprehensive understanding of connectivity in ASD.\n",
      "Title:  Abnormal autonomic and associated brain activities during rest in autism spectrumdisorder.\n",
      "Abstract:  Autism spectrum disorders are associated with social and emotional deficits, theaetiology of which are not well understood. A growing consensus is that theautonomic nervous system serves a key role in emotional processes, by providingphysiological signals essential to subjective states. We hypothesized thataltered autonomic processing is related to the socio_emotional deficits in autismspectrum disorders. Here, we investigated the relationship between non_specificskin conductance response, an objective index of sympathetic neural activity, andbrain fluctuations during rest in high_functioning adults with autism spectrumdisorder relative to neurotypical controls. Compared with control participants,individuals with autism spectrum disorder showed less skin conductance responsesoverall. They also showed weaker correlations between skin conductance responsesand frontal brain regions, including the anterior cingulate and anterior insularcortices. Additionally, skin conductance responses were found to have lesscontribution to default mode network connectivity in individuals with autismspectrum disorders relative to controls. These results suggest that autonomicprocessing is altered in autism spectrum disorders, which may be related to theabnormal socio_emotional behaviours that characterize this condition.\n",
      "Title:  A comparison of neuroimaging findings in childhood onset schizophrenia and autismspectrum disorder: a review of the literature.\n",
      "Abstract:  BACKGROUND: Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and childhood onset schizophrenia(COS) are pediatric neurodevelopmental disorders associated with significantmorbidity. Both conditions are thought to share an underlying geneticarchitecture. A comparison of neuroimaging findings across ASD and COS with afocus on altered neurodevelopmental trajectories can shed light on potentialclinical biomarkers and may highlight an underlying etiopathogenesis. METHODS: Acomprehensive review of the medical literature was conducted to summarizeneuroimaging data with respect to both conditions in terms of structural imaging(including volumetric analysis, cortical thickness and morphology, and region ofinterest studies), white matter analysis (include volumetric analysis anddiffusion tensor imaging) and functional connectivity. RESULTS: In ASD, a patternof early brain overgrowth in the first few years of life is followed bydysmaturation in adolescence. Functional analyses have suggested impairedlong_range connectivity as well as increased local and/or subcorticalconnectivity in this condition. In COS, deficits in cerebral volume, corticalthickness, and white matter maturation seem most pronounced in childhood andadolescence, and may level off in adulthood. Deficits in local connectivity, withincreased long_range connectivity have been proposed, in keeping with exaggeratedcortical thinning. CONCLUSION: The neuroimaging literature supports aneurodevelopmental origin of both ASD and COS and provides evidence for dynamicchanges in both conditions that vary across space and time in the developingbrain. Looking forward, imaging studies which capture the early post natalperiod, which are longitudinal and prospective, and which maximize the signal tonoise ratio across heterogeneous conditions will be required to translateresearch findings into a clinical environment.\n",
      "Title:  Structural and functional underconnectivity as a negative predictor for languagein autism.\n",
      "Abstract:  The development of language, social interaction, and communicative skills areremarkably different in the child with autism spectrum disorder (ASD). Atypicalbrain connectivity has frequently been reported in this patient population.However, the interplay between their brain connectivity and language performanceremains largely understudied. Using diffusion tensor imaging tractography andresting_state fMRI, the authors explored the structural and functionalconnectivity of the language network and its relation to the language profile ina group of healthy control subjects (N = 25) and a group of children with ASD (N= 17). The authors hypothesized that in children with ASD, a neural connectivitydeficit of the language network can be related to the observed abnormal languagefunction. They found an absence of the right_hemispheric arcuate fascicle (AF) in28% (7/25) of the healthy control children and in 59% (10/17) of the childrenwith ASD. In contrast to healthy control children, the absence of theright_hemispheric AF in children with autism was related to a lower languageperformance as indicated by a lower verbal IQ, lower scores on the PeabodyPicture Vocabulary Test, and lower language scores on the Dutch version of theClinical Evaluation of Language Fundamentals (CELF_4NL). In addition, throughiterative fMRI data analyses, the language impairment of children with ASD couldbe linked to a marked loss of intrahemispheric functional connectivity betweeninferior frontal and superior temporal regions, known as the cortical languagenetwork. Both structural and functional underconnectivity patterns coincide andare related to an abnormal language function in children with ASD.\n",
      "Title:  Age related changes in striatal resting state functional connectivity in autism.\n",
      "Abstract:  Characterizing the nature of developmental change is critical to understandingthe mechanisms that are impaired in complex neurodevelopment disorders such asautism spectrum disorder (ASD) and, pragmatically, may allow us to pinpointperiods of plasticity when interventions are particularly useful. Althoughaberrant brain development has long been theorized as a characteristic feature ofASD, the neural substrates have been difficult to characterize, in part due to alack of developmental data and to performance confounds. To address these issues,we examined the development of intrinsic functional connectivity, with restingstate fMRI from late childhood to early adulthood (8_36 years), using a seedbased functional connectivity method with the striatal regions. Overall, we foundthat both groups show decreases in cortico_striatal circuits over age. However,when controlling for age, ASD participants showed increased connectivity withparietal cortex and decreased connectivity with prefrontal cortex relative totypically developed (TD) participants. In addition, ASD participants showedaberrant age_related connectivity with anterior aspects of cerebellum, andposterior temporal regions (e.g., fusiform gyrus, inferior and superior temporalgyri). In sum, we found prominent differences in the development of striatalconnectivity in ASD, most notably, atypical development of connectivity instriatal networks that may underlie cognitive and social reward processing. Ourfindings highlight the need to identify the biological mechanisms ofperturbations in brain reorganization over development, which may also helpclarify discrepant findings in the literature.\n",

      "Abstract:  Recently, there has been a wealth of research into structural and functionalbrain connectivity, and how they change over development. While we are far from acomplete understanding, these studies have yielded important insights into humanbrain development. There is an ever growing variety of methods for assessingconnectivity, each with its own advantages. Here we review research on thedevelopment of structural and/or functional brain connectivity in both typicallydeveloping subjects and subjects with neurodevelopmental disorders. Spacelimitations preclude an exhaustive review of brain connectivity across alldevelopmental disorders, so we review a representative selection of recentfindings on brain connectivity in autism, Fragile X, 22q11.2 deletion syndrome,Williams syndrome, Turner syndrome, and ADHD. Major strides have been made inunderstanding the developmental trajectory of the human connectome, offeringinsight into characteristic features of brain development and biologicalprocesses involved in developmental brain disorders. We also discuss some commonor asymmetrydifferences. We conclude by discussing some promising future directions inconnectomics, including the merger of imaging and genetics, and a deeperinvestigation of the relationships between structural and functionalconnectivity.\n",
      "Title:  The brains of high functioning autistic individuals do not synchronize with thoseof others.\n",
      "Abstract:  Multifaceted and idiosyncratic aberrancies in social cognition characterizeautism spectrum disorders (ASDs). To advance understanding of underlying neuralmechanisms, we measured brain hemodynamic activity with functional magneticresonance imaging (fMRI) in individuals with ASD and matched_pair neurotypical(NT) controls while they were viewing a feature film portraying socialinteractions. Pearson's correlation coefficient was used as a measure ofvoxelwise similarity of brain activity (InterSubject Correlations_ISCs).Individuals with ASD showed lower ISC than NT controls in brain regionsimplicated in processing social information including the insula, posterior andanterior cingulate cortex, caudate nucleus, precuneus, lateral occipital cortex,and supramarginal gyrus. Curiously, also within NT group, autism_quotient scorespredicted ISC in overlapping areas, including, e.g., supramarginal gyrus andprecuneus. In ASD participants, functional connectivity was decreased between thefrontal pole and the superior frontal gyrus, angular gyrus, superior parietallobule, precentral gyrus, precuneus, and anterior/posterior cingulate gyrus.Taken together these results suggest that ISC and functional connectivity measuredistinct features of atypical brain function in high_functioning autisticindividuals during free viewing of acted social interactions. Our ISC resultssuggest that the minds of ASD individuals do not 'tick together' with otherswhile perceiving identical dynamic social interactions.\n",
      "Title:  Brain hyperconnectivity in children with autism and its links to social deficits.\n",
      "Abstract:  Autism spectrum disorder (ASD), a neurodevelopmental disorder affecting nearly 1in 88 children, is thought to result from aberrant brain connectivity.Remarkably, there have been no systematic attempts to characterize whole_brainconnectivity in children with ASD. Here, we use neuroimaging to show that thereare more instances of greater functional connectivity in the brains of childrenwith ASD in comparison to those of typically developing children.Hyperconnectivity in ASD was observed at the whole_brain and subsystems levels,and short_range connections, and was associated with higher levelsof fluctuations in regional brain signals. Brain hyperconnectivity predictedsymptom severity in ASD, such that children with greater functional connectivityexhibited more severe social deficits. We replicated these findings in twoadditional independent cohorts, demonstrating again that at earlier ages, thebrain of children with ASD is largely functionally hyperconnected in ways thatcontribute to social dysfunction. Our findings provide unique insights into brainmechanisms underlying childhood autism.\n",

      "Abstract:  Although growing evidence indicates atypical long_distance connectivity in autismspectrum disorder (ASD), much less is known about local connectivity, despiteconjectures that local overconnectivity may be causally involved in the disorder.Using functional connectivity MRI and graph theory, we found that localfunctional connectivity was atypically increased in adolescents with ASD intemporo_occipital regions bilaterally. Posterior overconnectivity was found to beassociated with higher ASD symptom severity, whereas an ASD subsample with lowseverity showed frontal underconnectivity. The findings suggest links betweensymptomatology and local connectivity, which vary within the autism spectrum.\n",
      "Title:  The development of the neural substrates of cognitive control in adolescents withautism spectrum disorders.\n",
      "Abstract:  BACKGROUND: Autism spectrum disorders (ASDs) involve impairments in cognitivecontrol. In typical development (TYP), neural systems underlying cognitivecontrol undergo substantial maturation during adolescence. Development is delayedin adolescents with ASD. Little is known about the neural substrates of thisdelay. METHODS: We used event_related functional magnetic resonance imaging and acognitive control task involving overcoming a prepotent response tendency toexamine the development of cognitive control in young (ages 12_15; n = 13 withASD and n = 13 with TYP) and older (ages 16_18; n = 14 with ASD and n = 14 withTYP) adolescents with whole_brain voxelwise univariate and task_relatedfunctional connectivity analyses. RESULTS: Older ASD and TYP showed reducedactivation in sensory and premotor areas relative to younger ones. The older ASDgroup showed reduced left parietal activation relative to TYP. Functionalconnectivity analyses showed a significant age by group interaction with theolder ASD group exhibiting increased functional connectivity strength between theventrolateral prefrontal cortex and the anterior cingulate cortex, bilaterally.This functional connectivity strength was related to task performance in ASD,whereas that between dorsolateral prefrontal cortex and parietal cortex (Brodmannareas 9 and 40) was related to task performance in TYP. CONCLUSIONS: Adolescentswith ASD rely more on reactive cognitive control, involving last_minute conflictdetection and control implementation by the anterior cingulate cortex andventrolateral prefrontal cortex, versus proactive cognitive control requiringprocessing by dorsolateral prefrontal cortex and parietal cortex. Findings awaitreplication in larger longitudinal studies that examine their functionalconsequences and amenability to intervention.\n",
      "Title:  Abnormal brain synchrony in Down Syndrome.\n",
      "Abstract:  Down Syndrome is the most common genetic cause for intellectual disability, yetthe pathophysiology of cognitive impairment in Down Syndrome is unknown. Wecompared fMRI scans of 15 individuals with Down Syndrome to 14 typicallydeveloping control subjects while they viewed 50 min of cartoon video clips.There was widespread increased synchrony between brain regions, with only a smallsubset of strong, distant connections showing underconnectivity in Down Syndrome.Brain regions showing negative correlations were less anticorrelated and wereamong the most strongly affected connections in the brain. Increased correlationwas observed between all of the distributed brain networks studied, with thestrongest internetwork correlation in subjects with the lowest performance IQ. Afunctional parcellation of the brain showed simplified network structure in DownSyndrome organized by local connectivity. Despite increased interregionalsynchrony, intersubject correlation to the cartoon stimuli was lower in DownSyndrome, indicating that increased synchrony had a temporal pattern that was notin response to environmental stimuli, but idiosyncratic to each Down Syndromesubject. Short_range, increased synchrony was not observed in a comparison sampleof 447 autism vs. 517 control subjects from the Autism Brain Imaging Exchange(ABIDE) collection of resting state fMRI data, and increased internetworksynchrony was only observed between the default mode and attentional networks inautism. These findings suggest immature development of connectivity in DownSyndrome with impaired ability to integrate information from distant brainregions into coherent distributed networks.\n",
      "Title:  fMRI investigation of visual change detection in adults with autism.\n",
      "Abstract:  People with autism spectrum disorders (ASD) may show unusual reactions tounexpected changes that appear in their environment. Although several studieshave highlighted atypical auditory change processing in ASD, little is known inthis disorder about the brain processes involved in visual automatic changedetection. The present fMRI study was designed to localize brain activityelicited by unexpected visual changing stimuli in adults with ASD compared tocontrols. Twelve patients with ASD and 17 healthy adults participated in theexperiment in which subjects were presented with a visual oddball sequence whileperforming a concurrent target detection task. Combined results acrossparticipants highlight the involvement of both occipital (BA 18/19) and frontal(BA 6/8) regions during visual change detection. However, adults with ASD displaygreater activity in the bilateral occipital cortex and in the anterior cingulatecortex (ACC) associated with smaller activation in the superior and middlefrontal gyri than controls. A psychophysiological interaction (PPI) analysis wasperformed with ACC as the seed region and revealed greater functionallyconnectivity to sensory regions in ASD than in controls, but less connectivity toprefrontal and orbito_frontal cortices. Thus, compared to controls, largersensory activation associated with reduced frontal activation was seen in ASDduring automatic visual change detection. Atypical psychophysiologicalinteractions between frontal and occipital regions were also found, congruentwith the idea of atypical connectivity between these regions in ASD. The atypicalinvolvement of the ACC in visual change detection can be related to abnormalitiespreviously observed in the auditory modality, thus supporting the hypothesis ofan altered general mechanism of change detection in patients with ASD that wouldunderlie their unusual reaction to change.\n",

      "Abstract:  In the course of development, the brain undergoes a remarkable process ofrestructuring as it adapts to the environment and becomes more efficient inprocessing information. A variety of brain imaging methods can be used to probehow anatomy, connectivity, and function change in the developing brain. Here wereview recent discoveries regarding these brain changes in both typicallydeveloping individuals and individuals with neurodevelopmental disorders. Webegin with typical development, summarizing research on changes in regional brainvolume and tissue density, cortical thickness, white matter integrity, andfunctional connectivity. Space limits preclude the coverage of allneurodevelopmental disorders; instead, we cover a representative selection ofstudies examining neural correlates of autism, attention deficit/hyperactivitydisorder, Fragile X, 22q11.2 deletion syndrome, Williams syndrome, Down syndrome,and Turner syndrome. Where possible, we focus on studies that identify an age bydiagnosis interaction, suggesting an altered developmental trajectory. Thestudies we review generally cover the developmental period from infancy to earlyadulthood. Great progress has been made over the last 20 years in mapping how thebrain matures with MR technology. With ever_improving technology, we expect thisprogress to accelerate, offering a deeper understanding of brain development, andmore effective interventions for neurodevelopmental disorders.\n",
      "Title:  Approaches to local connectivity in autism using resting state functionalconnectivity MRI.\n",
      "Abstract:  While the literature on aberrant long_distance connectivity in autism spectrumdisorder (ASD) has grown fast over the past decade, little is known about localconnectivity. We used regional homogeneity and local density approaches atdifferent spatial scales to examine local connectivity in 29 children andadolescents with ASD and 29 matched typically developing participants, usingresting state functional magnetic resonance imaging data. Across a total of 12analysis pipelines, the gross pattern of between_group findings was overallstable, with local overconnectivity in the ASD group in occipital and posteriortemporal regions and underconnectivity in middle/posterior cingulate, and medialprefrontal regions. This general pattern was confirmed in secondary analyses forlow_motion subsamples (n = 20 per group), in which time series segments with>0.25 mm head motion were censored, as well as in an analysis including globalsignal regression. Local overconnectivity in visual regions appears consistentwith preference for local over global visual processing previously reported inASD, whereas cingulate and medial frontal underconnectivity may relate toaberrant function within the default mode network.\n",
      "Title:  Identification of neural connectivity signatures of autism using machinelearning.\n",
      "Abstract:  Alterations in interregional neural connectivity have been suggested as asignature of the pathobiology of autism. There have been many reports offunctional and anatomical connectivity being altered while individuals withautism are engaged in complex cognitive and social tasks. Although disruptedinstantaneous correlation between cortical regions observed from functional MRIis considered to be an explanatory model for autism, the causal influence of abrain area on another (effective connectivity) is a vital link missing in thesestudies. The current study focuses on addressing this in an fMRI study ofTheory_of_Mind (ToM) in 15 high_functioning adolescents and adults with autismand 15 typically developing control participants. Participants viewed a series ofcomic strip vignettes in the MRI scanner and were asked to choose the mostlogical end to the story from three alternatives, separately for trials involvingphysical and intentional causality. The mean time series, extracted from 18activated regions of interest, were processed using a multivariate autoregressivemodel (MVAR) to obtain the causality matrices for each of the 30 participants.These causal connectivity weights, along with assessment scores, functionalconnectivity values, and fractional anisotropy obtained from DTI data for eachparticipant, were submitted to a recursive cluster elimination based supportvector machine classifier to determine the accuracy with which the classifier canpredict a novel participant's group membership (autism or control). We found amaximum classification accuracy of 95.9% with 19 features which had the highestdiscriminative ability between the groups. All of the 19 features were effectiveconnectivity paths, indicating that causal information may be critical indiscriminating between autism and control groups. These effective connectivitypaths were also found to be significantly greater in controls as compared to ASDparticipants and consisted predominantly of outputs from the fusiform face areaand middle temporal gyrus indicating impaired connectivity in ASD participants,particularly in the social brain areas. These findings collectively point towardthe fact that alterations in causal connectivity in the brain in ASD could serveas a potential non_invasive neuroimaging signature for autism.\n",

      "Abstract:  OBJECTIVE: To evaluate associations between neonatal intensive care unit (NICU)room type (open ward and private room) and medical outcomes; neurobehavior,electrophysiology, and brain structure at hospital discharge; and developmentaloutcomes at 2 years of age. STUDY DESIGN: In this prospective longitudinal cohortstudy, we enrolled 136 preterm infants born <30 weeks gestation from an urban,75_bed level III NICU from 2007_2010. Upon admission, each participant wasassigned to a bedspace in an open ward or private room within the same hospital,based on space and staffing availability, where they remained for the duration ofhospitalization. The primary outcome was developmental performance at 2 years ofage (n = 86 infants returned for testing, which was 83% of survivors) measuredusing the Bayley Scales of Infant and Toddler Development, 3rd Edition. Secondaryoutcomes were: (1) medical factors throughout the hospitalization; (2)neurobehavior; and (3) cerebral injury and maturation (determined by magneticresonance imaging and electroencephalography).

      "Title:  Abnormal functional connectivity during visuospatial processing is associatedwith disrupted organisation of white matter in autism.\n",
      "Abstract:  Disruption of structural and functional neural connectivity has been widelyreported in Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) but there is a striking lack ofresearch attempting to integrate analysis of functional and structuralconnectivity in the same study population, an approach that may provide keyinsights into the specific neurobiological underpinnings of altered functionalconnectivity in autism. The aims of this study were (1) to determine whetherfunctional connectivity abnormalities were associated with structuralabnormalities of white matter (WM) in ASD and (2) to examine the relationshipsbetween aberrant neural connectivity and behavior in ASD. Twenty_two individualswith ASD and 22 age, IQ_matched controls completed a high_angular_resolutiondiffusion MRI scan. Structural connectivity was analysed using constrainedspherical deconvolution (CSD) based tractography. Regions for tractography weregenerated from the results of a previous study, in which 10 pairs of brainregions showed abnormal functional connectivity during visuospatial processing inASD. WM tracts directly connected 5 of the 10 region pairs that showed abnormalfunctional connectivity; linking a region in the left occipital lobe (left BA19)and five paired regions: left caudate head, left caudate body, left uncus, leftthalamus, and left cuneus. Measures of WM microstructural organization wereextracted from these tracts. Fractional anisotropy (FA) reductions in the ASDgroup relative to controls were significant for WM connecting left BA19 to leftcaudate head and left BA19 to left thalamus. Using a multimodal imaging approach,this study has revealed aberrant WM microstructure in tracts that directlyconnect brain regions that are abnormally functionally connected in ASD. Theseresults provide novel evidence to suggest that structural brain pathology maycontribute (1) to abnormal functional connectivity and (2) to atypicalvisuospatial processing in ASD.\n",
      "Title:  Multisite functional connectivity MRI classification of autism: ABIDE results.\n",
      "Abstract:  BACKGROUND: Systematic differences in functional connectivity MRI metrics havebeen consistently observed in autism, with predominantly decreasedcortico_cortical connectivity. Previous attempts at single subject classificationin high_functioning autism using whole brain point_to_point functionalconnectivity have yielded about 80% accurate classification of autism vs. controlsubjects across a wide age range. We attempted to replicate the method andresults using the Autism Brain Imaging Data Exchange (ABIDE) including restingstate fMRI data obtained from 964 subjects and 16 separate international sites.METHODS: For each of 964 subjects, we obtained pairwise functional connectivitymeasurements from a lattice of 7266 regions of interest covering the gray matter(26.4 million \"connections\") after preprocessing that included motion and slicetiming correction, coregistration to an anatomic image, normalization to standardspace, and voxelwise removal by regression of motion parameters, soft tissue,CSF, and white matter signals. Connections were grouped into multiple bins, and aleave_one_out classifier was evaluated on connections comprising each set ofbins. Age, age_squared, gender, handedness, and site were included as covariatesfor the classifier. RESULTS: Classification accuracy significantly outperformedchance but was much lower for multisite prediction than for previous single siteresults. As high as 60% accuracy was obtained for whole brain classification,with the best accuracy from connections involving regions of the default modenetwork, parahippocampaland fusiform gyri, insula, Wernicke Area, andintraparietal sulcus. The classifier score was related to symptom severity,social function, daily living skills, and verbal IQ. Classification accuracy wassignificantly higher for sites with longer BOLD imaging times. CONCLUSIONS:Multisite functional connectivity classification of autism outperformed chanceusing a simple leave_one_out classifier, but exhibited poorer accuracy than forsingle site results. Attempts to use multisite classifiers will likely requireimproved classification algorithms, longer BOLD imaging times, and standardizedacquisition parameters for possible future clinical utility.\n",

      "Abstract:  The Abelson helper integration site 1 (AHI1) gene has a pivotal role in braindevelopment. Studies by our group and others have demonstrated association ofAHI1 with schizophrenia and autism. To elucidate the mechanism whereby alterationin AHI1 expression may be implicated in the pathogenesis of neuropsychiatricdisorders, we studied Ahi1 heterozygous knockout (Ahi1(+/_)) mice. Although theirperformance was not different from wild_type mice on tests that model classicalschizophrenia_related endophenotypes, Ahi1(+/_) mice displayed an anxiolytic_likephenotype across different converging modalities. Using behavioral paradigms thatinvolve exposure to environmental and social stress, significantly decreasedanxiety was evident in the open field, elevated plus maze and dark_light box, aswell as during social interaction in pairs. Assessment of core temperature andcorticosterone secretion revealed a significantly blunted response of theautonomic nervous system and the hypothalamic_pituitary_adrenal axis in Ahi1(+/_)mice exposed to environmental and visceral stress. However, response to centrallyacting anxiogenic compounds was intact. On resting_state functional MRI,connectivity of the amygdala with other brain regions involved in processing ofanxiogenic stimuli and inhibitory avoidance learning, such as the lateralentorhinal cortex, ventral hippocampus and ventral tegmental area, wassignificantly reduced in the mutant mice. Taken together, our data link Ahi1under_expression with a defect in the process of threat detection. Alternatively,the results could be interpreted as representing an anxiety_relatedendophenotype, possibly granting the Ahi1(+/_) mouse relative resilience tovarious types of stress. The current knockout model highlights the contributionof translational approaches to understanding the genetic basis of emotionalregulation and its associated neurocircuitry, with possible relevance toneuropsychiatric disorders.\n",

      "Abstract:  Autism spectrum disorders (ASD) are a group of complex and heterogeneousdevelopmental disorders involving multiple neural system dysfunctions. In aneffort to understand neurophysiological substrates, identifyetiopathophysiologically distinct subgroups of patients, and track outcomes ofnovel treatments with translational biomarkers, EEG (electroencephalography)studies offer a promising research strategy in ASD. Resting_state EEG studies ofASD suggest a U_shaped profile of electrophysiological power alterations, withexcessive power in low_frequency and high_frequency bands, abnormal functionalconnectivity, and enhanced power in the left hemisphere of the brain. In thisreview, we provide a summary of recent findings, discuss limitations in availableresearch that may contribute to inconsistencies in the literature, and offersuggestions for future research in this area for advancing the understanding ofASD.\n",
      "Title:  Equivalent neural responses in children and adolescents with and without autismduring judgments of affect.\n",
      "Abstract:  Previous research has noted disrupted patterns of neural activation duringemotion, processing in individuals with autism spectrum disorders (ASD). However,prior research relied on, designs that may place greater cognitive load onindividuals with ASD. In order to address this issue, we adapted the fMRI task ofOchsner et al. (2004a) for children by, presenting fewer stimuli, with fewervalence levels, and longer stimuli duration. A localizer sample of, typicallydeveloping children (n=26) was used to construct regions of interest involved inandother_referential emotion processing was, compared in age, IQ, gender matchedgroups (n=17 ASD, n=16 TD). Matched samples replicate, condition contrasts of thelocalizer, but no group differences were found in behavior measures or, neuralactivation. An exploratory functional connectivity analysis in a subset of thematched groups, also did not detect striking differences between the groups.These findings suggest that disruptions in activation in emotion processingneural networks in ASD is partially a function of task related cognitive load.\n",
      "Title:  Atypical modulation of distant functional connectivity by cognitive state inchildren with Autism Spectrum Disorders.\n",
      "Abstract:  We examined whether modulation of functional connectivity by cognitive statediffered between pre_adolescent children with Autism Spectrum Disorders (ASD) andage and IQ_matched control children. Children underwent functional magneticresonance imaging (fMRI) during two states, a resting state followed by asustained attention task. A voxel_wise method was used to characterize functionalconnectivity at two levels, local (within a voxel's 14 mm neighborhood) anddistant (outside of the voxel's 14 mm neighborhood to the rest of the brain) andregions exhibiting Group x State interaction were identified for both types ofconnectivity maps. Distant functional connectivity of regions in the left frontallobe (dorsolateral [BA 11, 10]; supplementary motor area extending into dorsalanterior cingulate [BA 32/8]; and premotor [BA 6, 8, 9]), right parietal lobe(paracentral lobule [BA 6]; angular gyrus [BA 39/40]), and left posterior middletemporal cortex (BA 19/39) showed a Group x State interaction such that relativeto the resting state, connectivity reduced (i.e., became focal) in controlchildren but increased (i.e., became diffuse) in ASD children during the taskstate. Higher state_related increase in distant connectivity of left frontal andright angular gyrus predicted worse inattention in ASD children. Two graph theorymeasures (global efficiency and modularity) were also sensitive to Group x Statedifferences, with the magnitude of state_related change predicting inattention inthe ASD children. Our results indicate that as ASD children transition from anunconstrained to a sustained attentional state, functional connectivity offrontal and parietal regions with the rest of the brain becomes more widespreadin a manner that may be maladaptive as it was associated with attention problemsin everyday life.\n",
      "Title:  Reconceptualizing functional brain connectivity in autism from a developmentalperspective.\n",
      "Abstract:  While there is almost universal agreement amongst researchers that autism isassociated with alterations in brain connectivity, the precise nature of thesealterations continues to be debated. Theoretical and empirical work is beginningto reveal that autism is associated with a complex functional phenotypeand hyper_connectivity of large_scale brain systems.It is not yet understood why such conflicting patterns of brain connectivity areobserved across different studies, and the factors contributing to theseheterogeneous findings have not been identified. Developmental changes infunctional connectivity have received inadequate attention to date. We proposethat discrepancies between findings of autism related hypo_connectivity andhyper_connectivity might be reconciled by taking developmental changes intoaccount. We review neuroimaging studies of autism, with an emphasis on functionalmagnetic resonance imaging studies of intrinsic functional connectivity inchildren, adolescents and adults. The consistent pattern emerging across severalstudies is that while intrinsic functional connectivity in adolescents and adultswith autism is generally reduced compared with age_matched controls, functionalconnectivity in younger children with the disorder appears to be increased. Wesuggest that by placing recent empirical findings within a developmentalframework, and explicitly characterizing age and pubertal stage in future work,andhyper_connectivity in the extant literature and arrive at a more comprehensiveunderstanding of the neurobiology of autism.\n",
      "Title:  Functional and structural connectivity of frontostriatal circuitry in AutismSpectrum Disorder.\n",
      "Abstract:  Abnormalities in frontostriatal circuitry potentially underlie the two coredeficits in Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD); social interaction and communicationdifficulties and restricted interests and repetitive behaviors. Whilst a fewstudies have examined connectivity within this circuitry in ASD, no previousstudy has examined both functional and structural connectivity within the samepopulation. The present study provides the first exploration of both functionaland structural frontostriatal connectivity in ASD. Twenty_eight right_handed3.57 years) and 27 right_handed male, age and IQ3.64 years) took part in the study. Resting statefunctional connectivity was carried out on 21 ASD and control participants, andtractography was carried out on 22 ASD and 24 control participants, afterexcluding subjects for excessive motion and poor data quality. Functionalconnectivity analysis was carried out between the frontal cortex and striatumafter which tractography was performed between regions that showed significantgroup differences in functional connectivity. The ASD group showed increasedfunctional connectivity between regions in the frontal cortex [anterior cingulatecortex (ACC), middle frontal gyrus (MFG), paracingulate gyrus (Pcg) andorbitofrontal cortex (OFC)], and striatum [nucleus accumbens (NAcc) and caudate].Increased functional connectivity between ACC and caudate was associated withdeactivation to social rewards in the caudate, as previously reported in the sameparticipants. Greater connectivity between the right MFG and caudate wasassociated with higher restricted interests and repetitive behaviors andconnectivity between the bilateral Pcg and NAcc, and the right OFC and NAcc, wasnegatively associated with social and communicative deficits. Although tractswere reliably constructed for each subject, there were no group differences instructural connectivity. Results are in keeping with previously reportedincreased corticostriatal functional connectivity in ASD.\n",
      "Title:  Default mode network connectivity and reciprocal social behavior in 22q11.2deletion syndrome.\n",
      "Abstract:  22q11.2 deletion syndrome (22q11DS) is a genetic mutation associated withdisorders of cortical connectivity and social dysfunction. However, little isknown about the functional connectivity (FC) of the resting brain in 22q11DS andits relationship with social behavior. A seed_based analysis of resting_statefunctional magnetic resonance imaging data was used to investigate FC associatedwith the posterior cingulate cortex (PCC), in (26) youth with 22qDS and (51)demographically matched controls. Subsequently, the relationship between PCCconnectivity and Social Responsiveness Scale (SRS) scores was examined in 22q11DSparticipants. Relative to 22q11DS participants, controls showed significantlystronger FC between the PCC and other default mode network (DMN) nodes, includingthe precuneus, precentral gyrus and left frontal pole. 22q11DS patients did notshow age_associated FC changes observed in typically developing controls.Increased connectivity between PCC, medial prefrontal regions and the anteriorcingulate cortex, was associated with lower SRS scores (i.e. improved socialcompetence) in 22q11DS. DMN integrity may play a key role in social informationprocessing. We observed disrupted DMN connectivity in 22q11DS, parallelingreports from idiopathic autism and schizophrenia. Increased strength oflong_range DMN connectivity was associated with improved social functioning in22q11DS. These findings support a 'developmental_disconnection' hypothesis ofsymptom development in this disorder.\n",
      "Title:  Intrinsic gray_matter connectivity of the brain in adults with autism spectrumdisorder.\n",
      "Abstract:  Autism spectrum disorders (ASD) are a group of neurodevelopmental conditions thatare accompanied by atypical brain connectivity. So far, in vivo evidence foratypical structural brain connectivity in ASD has mainly been based onneuroimaging studies of cortical white matter. However, genetic studies suggestthat abnormal connectivity in ASD may also affect neural connections within thecortical gray matter. Such intrinsic gray_matter connections are inherently moredifficult to describe in vivo but may be inferred from a variety of surface_basedgeometric features that can be measured using magnetic resonance imaging. Here,we present a neuroimaging study that examines the intrinsic cortico_corticalconnectivity of the brain in ASD using measures of \"cortical separationdistances\" to assess the global and local intrinsic \"wiring costs\" of the cortex(i.e., estimated length of horizontal connections required to wire the cortexwithin the cortical sheet). In a sample of 68 adults with ASD and matchedcontrols, we observed significantly reduced intrinsic wiring costs of cortex inASD, both globally and locally. Differences in global and local wiring cost werepredominantly observed in fronto_temporal regions and also significantlypredicted the severity of social and repetitive symptoms (respectively). Ourstudy confirms that atypical cortico_cortical \"connectivity\" in ASD is notrestricted to the development of white_matter connections but may also affect theintrinsic gray_matter architecture (and connectivity) within the cortical sheet.Thus, the atypical connectivity of the brain in ASD is complex, affecting bothgray and white matter, and forms part of the core neural substrates underlyingautistic symptoms.\n",
      "Title:  The perils of global signal regression for group comparisons: a case study ofAutism Spectrum Disorders.\n",
      "Abstract:  We have previously argued from a theoretical basis that the standard practice ofregression of the Global Signal from the fMRI time series in functionalconnectivity studies is ill advised, particularly when comparing groups ofparticipants. Here, we demonstrate in resting_state data from participants withan Autism Spectrum Disorder and matched controls that these concerns are alsowell founded in real data. Using the prior theoretical work to formulatepredictions, we show: (1) rather than simply altering the mean or range ofcorrelation values amongst pairs of brain regions, Global Signal Regressionsystematically alters the rank ordering of values in addition to introducingnegative values, (2) it leads to a reversal in the direction of group correlationdifferences relative to other preprocessing approaches, with a higher incidenceof both long_range and local correlation differences that favor the AutismSpectrum Disorder group, (3) the strongest group differences under otherpreprocessing approaches are the ones most altered by Global Signal Regression,and (4) locations showing group differences no longer agree with those showingcorrelations with behavioral symptoms within the Autism Spectrum Disorder group.The correlation matrices of both participant groups under Global SignalRegression were well predicted by our previous mathematical analyses,demonstrating that there is nothing mysterious about these results. Finally, whenindependent physiological nuisance measures are lacking, we provide a simplealternative approach for assessing and lessening the influence of globalcorrelations on group comparisons that replicates our previous findings. Whilethis alternative performs less well for symptom correlations than our favoredpreprocessing approach that includes removal of independent physiologicalmeasures, it is preferable to the use of Global Signal Regression, which preventsunequivocal conclusions about the direction or location of group differences.\n",
      "Title:  CNTNAP2 polymorphisms and structural brain connectivity: a diffusion_tensorimaging study.\n",
      "Abstract:  CNTNAP2 is a gene on chromosome 7 that has shown associations with autism andschizophrenia, and there is evidence that it plays an important role for neuronalsynchronization and brain connectivity. In this study, we assessed therelationship between Diffusion Tensor Imaging (DTI), a putative marker ofanatomical brain connectivity, and multiple single nucleotide polymorphisms(SNPs) spread out over this large gene. 81 healthy controls and 44 patients withschizophrenia (all Caucasian) underwent DTI and genotyping of 31 SNPs withinCNTNAP2. We employed Tract_based Spatial Statistics (TBSS) for inter_subjectbrain registration and computed average diffusivity values for six major whitematter tracts. Analyses of Covariance (ANCOVAs) were computed to test forpossible associations with genotypes. The strongest association, which survivedrigorous Bonferroni correction, was between rs2710126 genotype and FractionalAnisotropy (FA) in the uncinate fasciculus (p = .00003). This anatomical locationis particularly interesting given the enriched fronto_temporal expression ofCNTNAP2 in the developing brain. For this SNP, no phenotype association has beenreported before. There were several further genotype_DTI associations that werenominally significant but did not survive Bonferroni correction, including anassociation between axial diffusivity in the dorsal cingulum bundle and a regionin intron 13 (represented by rs2710102, rs759178, rs2538991), which haspreviously been reported to be associated with anterior_posterior functionalconnectivity. We present new evidence about the effects of CNTNAP2 on brainconnectivity, whose disruption has been hypothesized to be central toschizophrenia pathophysiology.\n",
      "Title:  The role of the posterior cingulate cortex in cognition and disease.\n",
      "Abstract:  The posterior cingulate cortex is a highly connected and metabolically activebrain region. Recent studies suggest it has an important cognitive role, althoughthere is no consensus about what this is. The region is typically discussed ashaving a unitary function because of a common pattern of relative deactivationobserved during attentionally demanding tasks. One influential hypothesis is thatthe posterior cingulate cortex has a central role in supportinginternally_directed cognition. It is a key node in the default mode network andshows increased activity when individuals retrieve autobiographical memories orplan for the future, as well as during unconstrained 'rest' when activity in thebrain is 'free_wheeling'. However, other evidence suggests that the region ishighly heterogeneous and may play a direct role in regulating the focus ofattention. In addition, its activity varies with arousal state and itsinteractions with other brain networks may be important for conscious awareness.Understanding posterior cingulate cortex function is likely to be of clinicalimportance. It is well protected against ischaemic stroke, and so there isrelatively little neuropsychological data about the consequences of focallesions. However, in other conditions abnormalities in the region are clearlylinked to disease. For example, amyloid deposition and reduced metabolism is seenearly in Alzheimer's disease. Functional neuroimaging studies show abnormalitiesin a range of neurological and psychiatric disorders including Alzheimer'sdisease, schizophrenia, autism, depression and attention deficit hyperactivitydisorder, as well as ageing. Our own work has consistently shown abnormalposterior cingulate cortex function following traumatic brain injury, whichpredicts attentional impairments. Here we review the anatomy and physiology ofthe region and how it is affected in a range of clinical conditions, beforediscussing its proposed functions. We synthesize key findings into a novel modelof the region's function (the 'Arousal, Balance and Breadth of Attention' model).Dorsal and ventral subcomponents are functionally separated and differences inregional activity are explained by considering: (i) arousal state; (ii) whetherattention is focused internally or externally; and (iii) the breadth ofattentional focus. The predictions of the model can be tested within theframework of complex dynamic systems theory, and we propose that the dorsalposterior cingulate cortex influences attentional focus by 'tuning' whole_brainmetastability and so adjusts how stable brain network activity is over time.\n",
      "Title:  Convergent Findings of Altered Functional and Structural Brain Connectivity inIndividuals with High Functioning Autism: A Multimodal MRI Study.\n",
      "Abstract:  Brain tissue changes in autism spectrum disorders seem to be rather subtle andwidespread than anatomically distinct. Therefore a multimodal, whole brainimaging technique appears to be an appropriate approach to investigate whetheralterations in white and gray matter integrity relate to consistent changes infunctional resting state connectivity in individuals with high functioning autism(HFA). We applied diffusion tensor imaging (DTI), voxel_based morphometry (VBM)and resting state functional connectivity magnetic resonance imaging (fcMRI) toassess differences in brain structure and function between 12 individuals withHFA (mean age 35.5, SD 11.4, 9 male) and 12 healthy controls (mean age 33.3, SD9.0, 8 male). Psychological measures of empathy and emotionality were obtainedand correlated with the most significant DTI, VBM and fcMRI findings. We foundthree regions of convergent structural and functional differences between HFAparticipants and controls. The right temporo_parietal junction area and the leftfrontal lobe showed decreased fractional anisotropy (FA) values along withdecreased functional connectivity and a trend towards decreased gray mattervolume. The bilateral superior temporal gyrus displayed significantly decreasedfunctional connectivity that was accompanied by the strongest trend of graymatter volume decrease in the temporal lobe of HFA individuals. FA decrease inthe right temporo_parietal region was correlated with psychological measurementsof decreased emotionality. In conclusion, our results indicate common sites ofstructural and functional alterations in higher order association cortex areasand may therefore provide multimodal imaging support to the long_standinghypothesis of autism as a disorder of impaired higher_order multisensoryintegration.\n",
      "Title:  Organization of brain networks governed by long_range connections index autistictraits in the general population.\n",
      "Abstract:  BACKGROUND: The dimensional approach to autism spectrum disorder (ASD) considersASD as the extreme of a dimension traversing through the entire population. Weexplored the potential utility of electroencephalography (EEG) functionalconnectivity as a biomarker. We hypothesized that individual differences inautistic traits of typical subjects would involve a long_range connectivitydiminution within the delta band. METHODS: Resting_state EEG functionalconnectivity was measured for 74 neurotypical subjects. All participants alsoprovided a questionnaire (Social Responsiveness Scale, SRS) that was completed byan informant who knows the participant in social settings. We conductedmultivariate regression between the SRS score and functional connectivity in allEEG frequency bands. We explored modulations of network graph metricscharacterizing the optimality of a network using the SRS score. RESULTS: Ourresults show a decay in functional connectivity mainly within the delta and thetabands (the lower part of the EEG spectrum) associated with an increasing numberof autistic traits. When inspecting the impact of autistic traits on the globalorganization of the functional network, we found that the optimal properties ofthe network are inversely related to the number of autistic traits, suggestingthat the autistic dimension, throughout the entire population, modulates theefficiency of functional brain networks. CONCLUSIONS: EEG functional connectivityat low frequencies and its associated network properties may be associated withsome autistic traits in the general population.\n",

      "Abstract:  IMPORTANCE: Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) affects 1 in 88 children and ischaracterized by a complex phenotype, including social, communicative, andsensorimotor deficits. Autism spectrum disorder has been linked with atypicalconnectivity across multiple brain systems, yet the nature of these differencesin young children with the disorder is not well understood. OBJECTIVES: Toexamine connectivity of large_scale brain networks and determine whether specificnetworks can distinguish children with ASD from typically developing (TD)children and predict symptom severity in children with ASD. DESIGN, SETTING, ANDPARTICIPANTS: Case_control study performed at Stanford University School ofMedicine of 20 children 7 to 12 years old with ASD and 20 age_, sex_, andIQ_matched TD children. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Between_group differences inintrinsic functional connectivity of large_scale brain networks, performance of aclassifier built to discriminate children with ASD from TD children based onspecific brain networks, and correlations between brain networks and coresymptoms of ASD. RESULTS: We observed stronger functional connectivity withinseveral large_scale brain networks in children with ASD compared with TDchildren. This hyperconnectivity in ASD encompassed salience, default mode,frontotemporal, motor, and visual networks. This hyperconnectivity result wasreplicated in an independent cohort obtained from publicly available databases.Using maps of each individual's salience network, children with ASD could bediscriminated from TD children with a classification accuracy of 78%, with 75%sensitivity and 80% specificity. The salience network showed the highestclassification accuracy among all networks examined, and the blood oxygen_leveldependent signal in this network predicted restricted and repetitive behaviorscores. The classifier discriminated ASD from TD in the independent sample with83% accuracy, 67% sensitivity, and 100% specificity. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE:Salience network hyperconnectivity may be a distinguishing feature in childrenwith ASD. Quantification of brain network connectivity is a step towarddeveloping biomarkers for objectively identifying children with ASD.\n",
      "Title:  Underconnectivity between voice_selective cortex and reward circuitry in childrenwith autism.\n",
      "Abstract:  Individuals with autism spectrum disorders (ASDs) often show insensitivity to thehuman voice, a deficit that is thought to play a key role in communicationdeficits in this population. The social motivation theory of ASD predicts thatimpaired function of reward and emotional systems impedes children with ASD fromactively engaging with speech. Here we explore this theory by investigatingdistributed brain systems underlying human voice perception in children with ASD.Using resting_state functional MRI data acquired from 20 children with ASD and 19and intelligence quotient_matched typically developing children, we examinedintrinsic functional connectivity of voice_selective bilateral posterior superiortemporal sulcus (pSTS). Children with ASD showed a striking pattern ofunderconnectivity between left_hemisphere pSTS and distributed nodes of thedopaminergic reward pathway, including bilateral ventral tegmental areas andnucleus accumbens, left_hemisphere insula, orbitofrontal cortex, and ventromedialprefrontal cortex. Children with ASD also showed underconnectivity betweenright_hemisphere pSTS, a region known for processing speech prosody, and theorbitofrontal cortex and amygdala, brain regions critical for emotion_relatedassociative learning. The degree of underconnectivity between voice_selectivecortex and reward pathways predicted symptom severity for communication deficitsin children with ASD. Our results suggest that weak connectivity ofvoice_selective cortex and brain structures involved in reward and emotion mayimpair the ability of children with ASD to experience speech as a pleasurablestimulus, thereby impacting language and social skill development in thispopulation. Our study provides support for the social motivation theory of ASD.\n",

      "Abstract:  Information processing in individuals with autism is marked by a unique interplayof strengths and weaknesses that in concert distinguishes social cognition inautism from individuals with typical_functioning brains. In autism, difficultieswith higher cognitive processing and enhancement of low_level visuospatialprocessing, such as in visual search tasks, may lead to diminished centralcoherence, which has the potential to hinder how an individual functions insocial interactions where integration of components such as intention, emotion,and context paints the global picture necessary for social processing.

      "Abstract:  The thalamus plays crucial roles in the development and mature functioning ofnumerous sensorimotor, cognitive and attentional circuits. Currently limitedevidence suggests that autism spectrum disorder may be associated with thalamicabnormalities, potentially related to sociocommunicative and other impairments inthis disorder. We used functional connectivity magnetic resonance imaging anddiffusion tensor imaging probabilistic tractography to study the functional andanatomical integrity of thalamo_cortical connectivity in children and adolescentswith autism spectrum disorder and matched typically developing children. Forconnectivity with five cortical seeds (prefontal, parieto_occipital, motor,somatosensory and temporal), we found evidence of both anatomical and functionalunderconnectivity. The only exception was functional connectivity with thetemporal lobe, which was increased in the autism spectrum disorders group,especially in the right hemisphere. However, this effect was robust only inpartial correlation analyses (partialling out time series from other corticalseeds), whereas findings from total correlation analyses suggest thattemporo_thalamic overconnectivity in the autism group was only relative to theunderconnectivity found for other cortical seeds. We also found evidence ofmicrostructural compromise within the thalamic motor parcel, associated withcompromise in tracts between thalamus and motor cortex, suggesting that thethalamus may play a role in motor abnormalities reported in previous autismstudies. More generally, a number of correlations of diffusion tensor imaging andfunctional connectivity magnetic resonance imaging measures with diagnostic andneuropsychological scores indicate involvement of abnormal thalamocorticalconnectivity in sociocommunicative and cognitive impairments in autism spectrumdisorder.\n",

      "Abstract:  Recently, there has been a wealth of research into structural and functionalbrain connectivity, and how they change over development. While we are far from acomplete understanding, these studies have yielded important insights into humanbrain development. There is an ever growing variety of methods for assessingconnectivity, each with its own advantages. Here we review research on thedevelopment of structural and/or functional brain connectivity in both typicallydeveloping subjects and subjects with neurodevelopmental disorders. Spacelimitations preclude an exhaustive review of brain connectivity across alldevelopmental disorders, so we review a representative selection of recentfindings on brain connectivity in autism, Fragile X, 22q11.2 deletion syndrome,Williams syndrome, Turner syndrome, and ADHD. Major strides have been made inunderstanding the developmental trajectory of the human connectome, offeringinsight into characteristic features of brain development and biologicalprocesses involved in developmental brain disorders. We also discuss some commonor asymmetrydifferences. We conclude by discussing some promising future directions inconnectomics, including the merger of imaging and genetics, and a deeperinvestigation of the relationships between structural and functionalconnectivity.\n",

A smaller hypothalamic volume has been reported inhealthy male A_allele carriers than in male GG homozygotes and in patients withASDs than in healthy controls. These findings prompt the hypothesis that male AAhomozygotes may have weaker hypothalamic functional connectivity when compared tomale G_allele carriers. We calculated local functional connectivity density (FCD)using a voxel_wise data_driven approach based on resting_state functional MRIdata in 270 young healthy subjects. Both the main effect of genotype and thegender_by_genotype interaction were considered. Of the whole brain, only thelocal FCD of the hypothalamus exhibited the main effect of genotype. Post_hoctesting revealed significantly lower local FCD in male AA homozygotes compared tomale G_allele carriers although there was only a trend of significance in thegender_by_genotype interaction. We further analyzed the resting_state functionalconnectivity (rsFC) of the hypothalamic region that demonstrating significantgenotype differences in local FCD. We found a significant gender_by_genotypeinteraction in rsFC between the hypothalamic region and the left dorsolateralprefrontal cortex, but no significant main effect of genotype was found. Post_hoctesting revealed that this rsFC was significantly weaker in male AA homozygotescompared to male G_allele carriers. Our findings identify gender_dependentmechanisms of OXTR rs53576 gene variation impacting the functional connectivityof the hypothalamus in healthy individuals and suggest that these mechanisms areimportant for understanding ASDs.\n",

      "Abstract:  Attempts to explicate the neural abnormalities behind autism spectrum disordersfrequently revealed impaired brain connectivity, yet our knowledge is limitedabout the alterations linked with autistic traits in the non_clinical population.In our study, we aimed at exploring the neural correlates of dimensional autistictraits using a dual approach of diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) and graphtheoretical analysis of resting state functional MRI data. Subjects were sampledfrom a public neuroimaging dataset of healthy volunteers. Inclusion criteria wereadult age (age: 18_65), availability of DTI and resting state functionalacquisitions and psychological evaluation including the Social ResponsivenessScale (SRS) and Autistic Spectrum Screening Questionnaire (ASSQ). The finalsubject cohort consisted of 127 neurotypicals. Global brain network structure wasdescribed by graph theoretical parameters: global and average local efficiency.Regional topology was characterized by degree and efficiency. We providedmeasurements for diffusion anisotropy. The association between autistic traitsand the neuroimaging findings was studied using a general linear model analysis,controlling for the effects of age, gender and IQ profile. Significant negativecorrelation was found between the degree and efficiency of the right posteriorcingulate cortex and autistic traits, measured by the combination of ASSQ and SRSscores. Autistic phenotype was associated with the decrease of whole_brain localefficiency. Reduction of diffusion anisotropy was found bilaterally in thetemporal fusiform and parahippocampal gyri. Numerous models describe the autisticbrain connectome to be dominated by reduced long_range connections and excessiveshort_range fibers. Our finding of decreased efficiency supports this hypothesisalthough the only prominent effect was seen in the posterior limbic lobe, whichis known to act as a connector hub. The neural correlates of the autistic traitin neurotypicals showed only limited similarities to the reported findings inclinical populations with low functioning autism.\n",
      "Title:  Shared and distinct intrinsic functional network centrality in autism andattention_deficit/hyperactivity disorder.\n",
      "Abstract:  BACKGROUND: Individuals with autism spectrum disorders (ASD) often exhibitsymptoms of attention_deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). Across bothdisorders, observations of distributed functional abnormalities suggest aberrantlarge_scale brain network connectivity. Yet, common and distinct networkcorrelates of ASD and ADHD remain unidentified. Here, we aimed to examinepatterns of dysconnection in school_age children with ASD and ADHD and typicallydeveloping children who completed a resting state functional magnetic resonanceimaging scan. METHODS: We measured voxelwise network centrality, functionalconnectivity metrics indexing local (degree centrality [DC]) and global(eigenvector centrality) functional relationships across the entire brainconnectome, in resting state functional magnetic resonance imaging data from 56children with ASD, 45 children with ADHD, and 50 typically developing children. Aone_way analysis of covariance, with group as fixed factor (whole_braincorrected), was followed by post hoc pairwise comparisons. RESULTS: Cortical andsubcortical areas exhibited centrality abnormalities, some common to both ADHDand ASD, such as in precuneus. Others were disorder_specific and includedADHD_related increases in DC in right striatum/pallidum, in contrast withASD_related increases in bilateral temporolimbic areas. Secondary analysesdifferentiating children with ASD into those with or without ADHD_likecomorbidity (ASD(+) and ASD(_), respectively) revealed that the ASD(+) groupshared ADHD_specific abnormalities in basal ganglia. By contrast, centralityincreases in temporolimbic areas characterized children with ASD regardless ofADHD_like comorbidity. At the cluster level, eigenvector centrality grouppatterns were similar to DC. CONCLUSIONS: ADHD and ASD are neurodevelopmentaldisorders with distinct and overlapping clinical presentations. This workprovides evidence for both shared and distinct underlying mechanisms at thelarge_scale network level.\n",
      "Title:  White matter and visuospatial processing in autism: a constrained sphericaldeconvolution tractography study.\n",
      "Abstract:  Autism spectrum disorders (ASDs) are associated with a marked disturbance ofneural functional connectivity, which may arise from disrupted organization ofwhite matter. The aim of this study was to use constrained sphericaldeconvolution (CSD)_based tractography to isolate and characterize majorintrahemispheric white matter tracts that are important in visuospatialprocessing. CSD_based tractography avoids a number of critical confounds that areassociated with diffusion tensor tractography, and to our knowledge, this is thefirst time that this advanced diffusion tractography method has been used inautism research. Twenty_five participants with ASD and aged 25, intelligencequotient_matched controls completed a high angular resolution diffusion imagingscan. The inferior fronto_occipital fasciculus (IFOF) and arcuate fasciculus wereisolated using CSD_based tractography. Quantitative diffusion measures of whitematter microstructural organization were compared between groups and associatedwith visuospatial processing performance. Significant alteration of white matterorganization was present in the right IFOF in individuals with ASD. In addition,poorer visuospatial processing was associated in individuals with ASD withdisrupted white matter in the right IFOF. Using a novel, advanced tractographymethod to isolate major intrahemispheric white matter tracts in autism, thisresearch has demonstrated that there are significant alterations in themicrostructural organization of white matter in the right IFOF in ASD. Thisalteration was associated with poorer visuospatial processing performance in theASD group. This study provides an insight into structural brain abnormalitiesthat may influence atypical visuospatial processing in autism.\n",
      "Title:  Brain function differences in language processing in children and adults withautism.\n",
      "Abstract:  Comparison of brain function between children and adults with autism provides anunderstanding of the effects of the disorder and associated maturationaldifferences on language processing. Functional imaging (functional magneticresonance imaging) was used to examine brain activation and corticalsynchronization during the processing of literal and ironic texts in 15 childrenwith autism, 14 children with typical development, 13 adults with autism, and 12adult controls. Both the children and adults with autism had lower functionalconnectivity (synchronization of brain activity among activated areas) than theirage and ability comparison group in the left hemisphere language network duringirony processing, and neither autism group had an increase in functionalconnectivity in response to increased task demands. Activation differences forthe literal and irony conditions occurred in key language_processing regions(left middle temporal, left pars triangularis, left pars opercularis, left medialfrontal, and right middle temporal). The children and adults with autism differedfrom each other in the use of some brain regions during the irony task, with theadults with autism having activation levels similar to those of the controlgroups. Overall, the children and adults with autism differed from the adult andchild controls in (a) the degree of network coordination, (b) the distribution ofthe workload among member nodes, and (3) the dynamic recruitment of regions inresponse to text content. Moreover, the differences between the two autism agegroups may be indicative of positive changes in the neural function related tolanguage processing associated with maturation and/or educational experience.\n",
      "Title:  [Seeking the aetiology of autistic spectrum disorder. Part 2: Functionalneuroimaging].\n",
      "Abstract:  Multiple functional imaging techniques help to a better understanding of theneurobiological basis of autism_spectrum disorders (ASD). The early functionalimaging studies on ASD focused on task_specific methods related to core symptomdomains and explored patterns of activation in response to face processing,theory of mind tasks, language processing and executive function tasks. On theother hand, fMRI research in ASD focused on the development of functionalconnectivity methods and has provided evidence of alterations in corticalconnectivity in ASD and establish autism as a disorder of under_connectivityamong the brain regions participating in cortical networks. This atypicalfunctional connectivity in ASD results in inefficiency and poor integration ofprocessing in network connections to achieve task performance. The goal of thisreview is to summarise the actual neuroimaging functional data and examine theirimplication for understanding of the neurobiology of ASD.\n",
      "Title:  Default mode network in childhood autism: posteromedial cortex heterogeneity andrelationship with social deficits.\n",
      "Abstract:  BACKGROUND: The default mode network (DMN), a brain system anchored in theposteromedial cortex, has been identified as underconnected in adults with autismspectrum disorder (ASD). However, to date there have been no attempts tocharacterize this network and its involvement in mediating social deficits inchildren with ASD. Furthermore, the functionally heterogeneous profile of theposteromedial cortex raises questions regarding how altered connectivitymanifests in specific functional modules within this brain region in childrenwith ASD. METHODS: Resting_state functional magnetic resonance imaging and ananatomically informed approach were used to investigate the functionalconnectivity of the DMN in 20 children with ASD and 19 age_, gender_, andIQ_matched typically developing (TD) children. Multivariate regression analyseswere used to test whether altered patterns of connectivity are predictive ofsocial impairment severity. RESULTS: Compared with TD children, children with ASDdemonstrated hyperconnectivity of the posterior cingulate and retrosplenialcortices with predominately medial and anterolateral temporal cortex. Incontrast, the precuneus in ASD children demonstrated hypoconnectivity with visualcortex, basal ganglia, and locally within the posteromedial cortex. Aberrantposterior cingulate cortex hyperconnectivity was linked with severity of socialimpairments in ASD, whereas precuneus hypoconnectivity was unrelated to socialdeficits. Consistent with previous work in healthy adults, a functionallyheterogeneous profile of connectivity within the posteromedial cortex in both TDand ASD children was observed. CONCLUSIONS: This work links hyperconnectivity ofDMN_related circuits to the core social deficits in young children with ASD andhighlights fundamental aspects of posteromedial cortex heterogeneity.\n",
      "Title:  [Autism and neural connectivity].\n",
      "Abstract:  INTRODUCTION: Recent studies have investigated functional and structural brainconnectivity in patients with autism spectrum disorders (ASD). Neuroimaging andelectroencephalographic studies have found evidences suggesting that connectivitypatterns are altered in ASD. AIMS: To review recent works from structural andfunctional neuroimaging and neurophysiological studies, and to provide a summaryof advances in research implicating disordered connectivity in ASD. DEVELOPMENT:Functional findings reveal that patients with ASD have deficit in long_distanceconnections (under_connectivity), with a most prominent deficit infronto_posterior connections. With regard to structural connectivity there isevidence of disruption to inter_hemispheric white matter structures. Lessfunctional studies reveal that patients with ASD also have an excess of localconnections (over_connectivity), but findings from structural studies areconsiderably more inconsistent. CONCLUSIONS: The converging findings offunctional connectivity abnormalities and white matter abnormalities in autismsuggest that alterations in neural connectivity and the communication betweendifferent brain regions may be involved in behavioral and cognitive deficitsassociated with autism.\n",
      "Title:  Dysmaturation of the default mode network in autism.\n",
      "Abstract:  Two hypotheses of autism spectrum disorder (ASD) propose that this condition ischaracterized by deficits in Theory of Mind and by hypoconnectivity betweenremote cortical regions with hyperconnectivity locally. The default mode network(DMN) is a set of remote, functionally connected cortical nodes less activeduring executive tasks than at rest and is implicated in Theory of Mind, episodicmemory, and other self_reflective processes. We show that children with ASD havereduced connectivity between DMN nodes and increased local connectivity withinDMN nodes and the visual and motor resting_state networks. We show that, like thetrajectory of synaptogenesis, internodal DMN functional connectivity increased asa quadratic function of age in typically developing children, peaking between, 11and 13 years. In children with ASD, these long_distance connections fail todevelop during adolescence. These findings support the \"developmentaldisconnection model\" of ASD, provide a possible mechanistic explanation for theTheory_of_Mind hypothesis of ASD, and show that the window for effectivelytreating ASD could be wider than previously thought.\n",
      "Title:  Direct gaze elicits atypical activation of the theory_of_mind network in autismspectrum conditions.\n",
      "Abstract:  Eye contact plays a key role in social interaction and is frequently reported tobe atypical in individuals with autism spectrum conditions (ASCs). Despite theimportance of direct gaze, previous functional magnetic resonance imaging in ASChas generally focused on paradigms using averted gaze. The current study soughtto determine the neural processing of faces displaying direct and averted gaze in18 males with ASC and 23 matched controls. Controls showed an increased responseto direct gaze in brain areas implicated in theory_of_mind and gaze perception,including medial prefrontal cortex, temporoparietal junction, posterior superiortemporal sulcus region, and amygdala. In contrast, the same regions showed anincreased response to averted gaze in individuals with an ASC. This differencewas confirmed by a significant gaze direction x group interaction. Relative tocontrols, participants with ASC also showed reduced functional connectivitybetween these regions. We suggest that, in the typical brain, perceiving anotherperson gazing directly at you triggers spontaneous attributions of mental states(e.g. he is \"interested\" in me), and that such mental state attributions todirect gaze may be reduced or absent in the autistic brain.\n",
      "Title:  Amygdala habituation and prefrontal functional connectivity in youth with autismspectrum disorders.\n",
      "Abstract:  OBJECTIVE: Amygdala habituation, the rapid decrease in amygdala responsiveness tothe repeated presentation of stimuli, is fundamental to the nervous system.Habituation is important for maintaining adaptive levels of arousal topredictable social stimuli and decreased habituation is associated withheightened anxiety. Input from the ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC)regulates amygdala activity. Although previous research has shown abnormalamygdala function in youth with autism spectrum disorders (ASD), no study hasexamined amygdala habituation in a young sample or whether habituation is relatedto amygdala connectivity with the vmPFC. METHOD: Data were analyzed from 32children and adolescents with ASD and 56 typically developing controls whounderwent functional magnetic resonance imaging while performing a genderidentification task for faces that were fearful, happy, sad, or neutral.Habituation was tested by comparing amygdala activation to faces during the firsthalf versus the second half of the session. VmPFC_amygdala connectivity wasexamined through psychophysiologic interaction analysis. RESULTS: Youth with ASDhad decreased amygdala habituation to sad and neutral faces compared withcontrols. Moreover, decreased amygdala habituation correlated with autismseverity as measured by the Social Responsiveness Scale. There was a groupdifference in vmPFC_amygdala connectivity while viewing sad faces, andconnectivity predicted amygdala habituation to sad faces in controls.CONCLUSIONS: Sustained amygdala activation to faces suggests that repeated facepresentations are processed differently in individuals with ASD, which couldcontribute to social impairments. Abnormal modulation of the amygdala by thevmPFC may play a role in decreased habituation.\n",
      "Title:  The UCLA multimodal connectivity database: a web_based platform for brainconnectivity matrix sharing and analysis.\n",
      "Abstract:  Brain connectomics research has rapidly expanded using functional MRI (fMRI) anddiffusion_weighted MRI (dwMRI). A common product of these varied analyses is aconnectivity matrix (CM). A CM stores the connection strength between any tworegions (\"nodes\") in a brain network. This format is useful for several reasons:(1) it is highly distilled, with minimal data size and complexity, (2) graphtheory can be applied to characterize the network's topology, and (3) it retainssufficient information to capture individual differences such as age, gender,intelligence quotient (IQ), or disease state. Here we introduce the UCLAMultimodal Connectivity Database (http://umcd.humanconnectomeproject.org), anopenly available website for brain network analysis and data sharing. The site isa repository for researchers to publicly share CMs derived from their data. Thesite also allows users to select any CM shared by another user, compute graphtheoretical metrics on the site, visualize a report of results, or download theraw CM. To date, users have contributed over 2000 individual CMs, spanningdifferent imaging modalities (fMRI, dwMRI) and disorders (Alzheimer's, autism,Attention Deficit Hyperactive Disorder). To demonstrate the site's functionality,whole brain functional and structural connectivity matrices are derived from 60subjects' (ages 26_45) resting state fMRI (rs_fMRI) and dwMRI data and uploadedto the site. The site is utilized to derive graph theory global and regionalmeasures for the rs_fMRI and dwMRI networks. Global and nodal graph theoreticalmeasures between functional and structural networks exhibit low correspondence.This example demonstrates how this tool can enhance the comparability of brainnetworks from different imaging modalities and studies. The existence of thisconnectivity_based repository should foster broader data sharing and enablelarger_scale meta_analyses comparing networks across imaging modality, age group,and disease state.\n",
      "Title:  Differential deactivation during mentalizing and classification of autism basedon default mode network connectivity.\n",
      "Abstract:  The default mode network (DMN) is a collection of brain areas found to beconsistently deactivated during task performance. Previous neuroimaging studiesof resting state have revealed reduced task_related deactivation of this networkin autism. We investigated the DMN in 13 high_functioning adults with autismspectrum disorders (ASD) and 14 typically developing control participants duringthree fMRI studies (two language tasks and a Theory_of_Mind (ToM) task). Eachstudy had separate blocks of fixation/resting baseline. The data from the taskblocks and fixation blocks were collated to examine deactivation and functionalconnectivity. Deficits in the deactivation of the DMN in individuals with ASDwere specific only to the ToM task, with no group differences in deactivationduring the language tasks or a combined language and self_other discriminationtask. During rest blocks following the ToM task, the ASD group showed lessdeactivation than the control group in a number of DMN regions, including medialprefrontal cortex (MPFC), anterior cingulate cortex, and posterior cingulategyrus/precuneus. In addition, we found weaker functional connectivity of the MPFCin individuals with ASD compared to controls. Furthermore, we were able toreliably classify participants into ASD or typically developing control groupsbased on both the whole_brain and seed_based connectivity patterns with accuracyup to 96.3%. These findings indicate that deactivation and connectivity of theDMN were altered in individuals with ASD. In addition, these findings suggestthat the deficits in DMN connectivity could be a neural signature that can beused for classifying an individual as belonging to the ASD group.\n",
      "Title:  Disruption of functional organization within the primary motor cortex in childrenwith autism.\n",
      "Abstract:  Accumulating evidence suggests that motor impairments are prevalent in autismspectrum disorder (ASD), relate to the social and communicative deficits at thecore of the diagnosis and may reflect abnormal connectivity within brain networksunderlying motor control and learning. Parcellation of resting_state functionalconnectivity data using spectral clustering approaches has been shown to be aneffective means of visualizing functional organization within the brain but hasmost commonly been applied to explorations of normal brain function. This articlepresents a parcellation of a key area of the motor network, the primary motorcortex (M1), a key area of the motor control network, in adults, typicallydeveloping (TD) children and children with ASD and introduces methods forselecting the number of parcels, matching parcels across groups and testing groupdifferences. The parcellation is based solely on patterns of connectivity betweenindividual M1 voxels and all voxels outside of M1, and within all groups, a grossdorsomedial to ventrolateral organization emerged within M1 which was left_rightsymmetric. Although this gross organizational scheme was present in both groupsof children, statistically significant group differences in the size andsegregation of M1 parcels within regions of the motor homunculus corresponding tothe upper and lower limbs were observed. Qualitative comparison of the M1parcellation for children with ASD with that of younger and older TD childrensuggests that these organizational differences, with a lack of differentiationbetween lower limb/trunk regions and upper limb/hand regions, may be due, atleast in part, to a delay in functional specialization within the motor cortex.\n",
      "Title:  Hard to \"tune in\": neural mechanisms of live face_to_face interaction withhigh_functioning autistic spectrum disorder.\n",
      "Abstract:  Persons with autism spectrum disorders (ASD) are known to have difficulty in eyecontact (EC). This may make it difficult for their partners during face to facecommunication with them. To elucidate the neural substrates of live inter_subjectinteraction of ASD patients and normal subjects, we conducted hyper_scanningfunctional MRI with 21 subjects with autistic spectrum disorder (ASD) paired withtypically_developed (normal) subjects, and with 19 pairs of normal subjects as acontrol. Baseline EC was maintained while subjects performed real_timejoint_attention task. The task_related effects were modeled out, andinter_individual correlation analysis was performed on the residual time_coursedata. ASD_Normal pairs were less accurate at detecting gaze direction thanNormal_Normal pairs. Performance was impaired both in ASD subjects and in theirnormal partners. The left occipital pole (OP) activation by gaze processing wasreduced in ASD subjects, suggesting that deterioration of eye_cue detection inASD is related to impairment of early visual processing of gaze. On the otherhand, their normal partners showed greater activity in the bilateral occipitalcortex and the right prefrontal area, indicating a compensatory workload.Inter_brain coherence in the right IFG that was observed in the Normal_Normalpairs (Saito et al., 2010) during EC diminished in ASD_Normal pairs. Intra_brainfunctional connectivity between the right IFG and right superior temporal sulcus(STS) in normal subjects paired with ASD subjects was reduced compared with inNormal_Normal pairs. This functional connectivity was positively correlated withperformance of the normal partners on the eye_cue detection. Considering theintegrative role of the right STS in gaze processing, inter_subjectsynchronization during EC may be a prerequisite for eye cue detection by thenormal partner.\n",
      "Title:  Extracting multiscale pattern information of fMRI based functional brainconnectivity with application on classification of autism spectrum disorders.\n",
      "Abstract:  We employed a multi_scale clustering methodology known as \"data cloud geometry\"to extract functional connectivity patterns derived from functional magneticresonance imaging (fMRI) protocol. The method was applied to correlation matricesof 106 regions of interest (ROIs) in 29 individuals with autism spectrumdisorders (ASD), and 29 individuals with typical development (TD) while theycompleted a cognitive control task. Connectivity clustering geometry was examinedat both \"fine\" and \"coarse\" scales. At the coarse scale, the connectivityclustering geometry produced 10 valid clusters with a coherent relationship toneural anatomy. A supervised learning algorithm employed fine scale informationabout clustering motif configurations and prevalence, and coarse scaleand inter_regional connectivity; the algorithm correctlyclassified ASD and TD participants with sensitivity of 82.8% and specificity of82.8%. Most of the predictive power of the logistic regression model resided atthe level of the fine_scale clustering geometry, suggesting that cellular versussystems level disturbances are more prominent in individuals with ASD. Thisarticle provides validation for this multi_scale geometric approach to extractingbrain functional connectivity pattern information and for its use inclassification of ASD.\n",
      "Title:  State_dependent changes of connectivity patterns and functional brain networktopology in autism spectrum disorder.\n",
      "Abstract:  Anatomical and functional brain studies have converged to the hypothesis thatautism spectrum disorders (ASD) are associated with atypical connectivity. Usinga modified resting_state paradigm to drive subjects' attention, we provideevidence of a very marked interaction between ASD brain functional connectivityand cognitive state. We show that functional connectivity changes in oppositeways in ASD and typicals as attention shifts from external world towards one'sbody generated information. Furthermore, ASD subject alter more markedly thantypicals their connectivity across cognitive states. Using differences in brainconnectivity across conditions, we ranked brain regions according to theirclassification power. Anterior insula and dorsal_anterior cingulate cortex werethe regions that better characterize ASD differences with typical subjects acrossconditions, and this effect was modulated by ASD severity. These results pave thepath for diagnosis of mental pathologies based on functional brain networksobtained from a library of mental states.\n",

      "Abstract:  Studies of autism spectrum disorders (ASDs) reveal dysfunction in the neuralsystems mediating object processing (particularly faces) and social cognition,but few investigations have systematically assessed the specificity of thedysfunction. We compared cortical responses in typically developing adolescentsand those with ASD to stimuli from distinct conceptual domains known to elicitcategory_related activity in separate neural systems. In Experiment 1, subjectsmade category decisions to photographs, videos, and point_light displays ofpeople and tools. In Experiment 2, subjects interpreted displays of simple,geometric shapes in motion depicting social or mechanical interactions. In bothexperiments, we found a selective deficit in the ASD subjects for dynamic socialstimuli (videos and point_light displays of people, moving geometric shapes), butnot static images, in the functionally localized lateral region of the rightfusiform gyrus, including the fusiform face area. In contrast, no groupdifferences were found in response to either static images or dynamic stimuli inother brain regions associated with face and social processing (e.g. posteriorsuperior temporal sulcus, amygdala), suggesting disordered connectivity betweenthese regions and the fusiform gyrus in ASD. This possibility was confirmed byfunctional connectivity analysis.\n",
      "Title:  Functional brain networks and white matter underlying theory_of_mind in autism.\n",
      "Abstract:  Human beings constantly engage in attributing causal explanations to one's ownand to others' actions, and theory_of_mind (ToM) is critical in making suchinferences. Although children learn causal attribution early in development,children with autism spectrum disorders (ASDs) are known to have impairments inthe development of intentional causality. This functional magnetic resonanceimaging (fMRI) and diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) study investigated the neuralcorrelates of physical and intentional causal attribution in people with ASDs. Inand IQ_matchedtypically developing peers made causal judgments about comic strips presentedrandomly in an event_related design. All participants showed robust activation inbilateral posterior superior temporal sulcus at the temporo_parietal junction(TPJ) in response to intentional causality. Participants with ASDs showed loweractivation in TPJ, right inferior frontal gyrus and left premotor cortex.Significantly weaker functional connectivity was also found in the ASD groupbetween TPJ and motor areas during intentional causality. DTI data revealedsignificantly reduced fractional anisotropy in ASD participants in white matterunderlying the temporal lobe. In addition to underscoring the role of TPJ in ToM,this study found an interaction between motor simulation and mentalizing systemsin intentional causal attribution and its possible discord in autism.\n",
      "Title:  Functional alterations in neural substrates of geometric reasoning in adults withhigh_functioning autism.\n",
      "Abstract:  Individuals with autism spectrum condition (ASC) are known to excel in someperceptual cognitive tasks, but such developed functions have been often regardedas \"islets of abilities\" that do not significantly contribute to broaderintellectual capacities. However, recent behavioral studies have reported thatindividuals with ASC have advantages for performing Raven's (Standard)Progressive Matrices (RPM/RSPM), a standard neuropsychological test for generalfluid intelligence, raising the possibility that ASC's cognitive strength can beutilized for more general purposes like novel problem solving. Here, the brainactivity of 25 adults with high_functioning ASC and 26 matched normal controls(NC) was measured using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to examineneural substrates of geometric reasoning during the engagement of a modifiedversion of the RSPM test. Among the frontal and parietal brain regions involvedin fluid intelligence, ASC showed larger activation in the left lateraloccipitotemporal cortex (LOTC) during an analytic condition with moderatedifficulty than NC. Activation in the left LOTC and ventrolateral prefrontalcortex (VLPFC) increased with task difficulty in NC, whereas such modulation ofactivity was absent in ASC. Furthermore, functional connectivity analysisrevealed a significant reduction of activation coupling between the left inferiorparietal cortex and the right anterior prefrontal cortex during both figural andanalytic conditions in ASC. These results indicate altered pattern of functionalspecialization and integration in the neural system for geometric reasoning inASC, which may explain its atypical cognitive pattern, including performance onthe Raven's Matrices test.\n",

      "Abstract:  Abnormalities in structural and functional connectivity have been reported inautism spectrum disorders (ASD) across a wide age range. However, developmentalchanges in white matter microstructure are poorly understood. We used across_sectional design to determine whether white matter abnormalities measuredusing diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) were present in adolescents and adults withASD and whether age_related changes in white matter microstructure differedbetween ASD and typically developing (TD) individuals. Participants included 28individuals with ASD and 33 TD controls matched on age and IQ and assessed at onetime point. Widespread decreased fractional anisotropy (FA), and increased radialdiffusivity (RaD) and mean diffusivity (MD) were observed in the ASD groupcompared to the TD group. In addition, significant group_by_age interactions wereobserved in FA, RaD, and MD in all major tracts except the brain stem, indicatingthat age_related changes in white matter microstructure differed between thegroups. We propose that white matter microstructural changes in ASD may reflectmyelination and/or other structural differences including differences in axonaldensity/arborization. In addition, we suggest that white matter microstucturalimpairments may be normalizing during young adulthood in ASD. Future longitudinalstudies that include a wider range of ages and more extensive clinicalcharacterization will be critical for further uncovering the neurodevelopmentalprocesses unfolding during this dynamic time in development.\n",
      "Title:  Atypical visuospatial processing in autism: insights from functional connectivityanalysis.\n",
      "Abstract:  Atypical visuospatial processing is commonly described in autism spectrumdisorders (ASDs); however the specific neurobiological underpinnings of thisphenomenon are poorly understood. Given the extensive evidence suggesting ASDsare characterized by abnormal neural connectivity, this study aimed toinvestigate network connectivity during visuospatial processing in ASD.Twenty_two males with ASD without intellectual disability and 22 individuallymatched controls performed a mental rotation task during functional magneticresonance imaging (MRI) in which two rotated stimuli were judged to be same(\"Same Trials\") or mirror_imaged (\"Mirror Trials\"). Behavioral results revealed arelative advantage of mental rotation in the ASD group_controls were slowerresponding to the more difficult Mirror Trials than Same Trials whereas the ASDgroup completed Mirror Trials and Same_trials at similar speeds. In the ASDgroup, brain activity was reduced in frontal, temporal, occipital, striatal, andcerebellar regions and, consistent with previous literature, functionalconnectivity between a number of brain regions was reduced. However, someconnections appeared to be conserved and were recruited in a qualitativelydifferent way by the two groups. As task difficulty increased (on Mirror Trials),controls tended to increase connections between certain brain regions, whereasthe ASD group appeared to suppress connections between these regions. There wasan interesting exception to this pattern in the visual cortex, a finding that maysuggest an advantage in early visual perceptual processing in ASD. Overall, thisstudy has identified a relative advantage in mental rotation in ASD that isassociated with aberrant neural connectivity and that may stem from enhancedvisual perceptual processing.\n",
      "Title:  Atypical lexicosemantic function of extrastriate cortex in autism spectrumdisorder: evidence from functional and effective connectivity.\n",
      "Abstract:  Previous studies have suggested atypically enhanced activity of visual cortexduring language processing in autism spectrum disorder (ASD). However, it remainsunclear whether visual cortical participation reflects isolated processing withinposterior regions or functional cooperation with distal brain regions, such asleft inferior frontal gyrus (LIFG). We addressed this question using functionalconnectivity MRI (fcMRI) and structural equation modeling in 14 adolescents andadults with ASD and 14 matched typically developing (TD) participants. Data wereanalyzed to isolate low_frequency intrinsic fluctuations, by regressing outeffects of a semantic decision task. For a right extrastriate seed derived fromthe strongest cluster of atypical activation in the ASD group, widespread effectsof increased connectivity in prefrontal and medial frontal lobes bilaterally wereobserved for the ASD group, compared to the TD group. A second analysis for aseed in LIFG, derived from pooled activation effects in both groups, also yieldedwidespread effects of overconnectivity in the ASD group, especially in temporallobes. Structural equation modeling showed that whereas right extrastriate cortexdid not impact function of language regions (left and right IFG, left middletemporal gyrus) in the TD model, it was an integral part of a language circuit inthe ASD group. These results suggest that atypical extrastriate activation duringlanguage processing in ASD reflects integrative (not isolated) processing.Furthermore, our findings are inconsistent with previous reports of functionalunderconnectivity in ASD, probably related to removal of task effects required toisolate intrinsic low_frequency fluctuations.\n",
      "Title:  Reduced functional connectivity within and between 'social' resting statenetworks in autism spectrum conditions.\n",
      "Abstract:  Individuals with autism spectrum conditions (ASC) have difficulties in socialinteraction and communication, which is reflected in hypoactivation of brainregions engaged in social processing, such as medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC),amygdala and insula. Resting state studies in ASC have identified reducedconnectivity of the default mode network (DMN), which includes mPFC, suggestingthat other resting state networks incorporating 'social' brain regions may alsobe abnormal. Using seed_based connectivity and group independent componentanalysis (ICA) approaches, we looked at resting functional connectivity in ASCbetween specific 'social' brain regions, as well as within and between wholenetworks incorporating these regions. We found reduced functional connectivitywithin the DMN in individuals with ASC, using both ICA and seed_based approaches.Two further networks identified by ICA, the salience network, incorporating theinsula and a medial temporal lobe network, incorporating the amygdala, showedreduced inter_network connectivity. This was underlined by reduced seed_basedconnectivity between the insula and amygdala. The results demonstratesignificantly reduced functional connectivity within and between resting statenetworks incorporating 'social' brain regions. This reduced connectivity mayresult in difficulties in communication and integration of information acrossthese networks, which could contribute to the impaired processing of socialsignals in ASC.\n",
      "Title:  Functional connectivity for an \"island of sparing\" in autism spectrum disorder:an fMRI study of visual search.\n",
      "Abstract:  Although autism is usually characterized with respect to sociocommunicativeimpairments, visual search is known as a domain of relative performance strengthin this disorder. This study used functional MRI during visual search in childrenwith autism spectrum disorder (n = 19; mean age = 13;10) and matched typicallydeveloping children (n = 19; mean age = 14;0). We selected regions of interestwithin two attentional networks known to play a crucial role in visual searchprocesses, such as goal_directed selective attention, filtering of irrelevantdistractors, and detection of behaviorally_relevant information, and examinedactivation and connectivity within and between these attentional networks.Additionally, based on prior research suggesting links between visual searchabilities and autism symptomatology, we tested for correlations betweensociocommunicative impairments and behavioral and neural indices of search.Contrary to many previous functional connectivity magnetic resonance imagingstudies of autism that reported functional underconnectivity for task domains ofweakness, we found atypically increased connectivity within and betweenattentional networks in autism. Additionally, we found increased functionalconnectivity for occipital regions, both locally and for long_distanceconnections with frontal regions. Both behavioral and neural indices of searchwere correlated with sociocommunicative impairment in children with autism. Thisassociation suggests that strengths in nonsocial visuospatial processing may berelated to the development of core autistic sociocommunicative impairments.\n",

      "Abstract:  Understanding of brain structural anomalies seen in children with autism hasconsiderably progressed since the apparition of MRI and functional imaging. Allthe results are converging toward the description of anatomical and functionalanomalies in the regions of the so_called \"social brain\". Statistical analysesshow diminution of gray matter in the region of the superior temporal sulcus(STS). Functional studies with PET shows a diminution of brain blood flow at restin the same region. Brain activation studies show absence of activation of thespecialized region in processing human voice and hypoactivation of \"social brain\"regions in complex tasks of social cognition. At last, abnormal connectivitybetween the frontal and temporal regions has been showed. Those regions areimplicated in processing sensorial inputs necessary for normal social life. Allthose anomalies could be responsible of the abnormal social behaviour pattern ofchildren with autism.\n",
      "Title:  An fMRI study of reduced perceptual load_dependent modulation of task_irrelevantactivity in adults with autism spectrum conditions.\n",
      "Abstract:  Recent studies on selective attention have demonstrated that the perceptual loadof a task determines the processing stage at which irrelevant sensory stimuli arefiltered out. Although individuals with autism spectrum conditions (ASC) havebeen repeatedly reported to display several kinds of abnormal behavior related toattention deficits, the neural mechanisms underlying these deficits have not beenwell investigated within the framework of the load dependency of selectiveattention. The present study used functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) toexamine the brain responses of adults with high_functioning ASC to irrelevantvisual distractors while performing a visual target detection task under high orlow perceptual load. We observed that the increased perceptual load activatedregions of the fronto_parietal attention network of controls and ASC comparably.On the other hand, the visual cortex activity evoked by visual distractors wasless modulated by the increased perceptual load in ASC than in controls. Simpleregression analyses showed that the degree of the modulation was significantlycorrelated with the severity of the autistic symptoms. We also observed reducedload_dependent modulation of the functional connectivity between theintraparietal and visual regions in the ASC group. These results revealed neuralcorrelates for abnormal perceptual load_dependent engagement of visual attentionin ASC, which may underlie aspects of cognitive and behavioral characteristics ofthese disorders.\n",
      "Title:  Regional EEG alpha power, coherence, and behavioral symptomatology in autismspectrum disorder.\n",
      "Abstract:  OBJECTIVE: Although distinct patterns of resting brain electrical activity (EEG)and functional connectivity are believed to distinguish individuals with autismspectrum disorders (ASD) from their unimpaired peers, researchers have onlyrecently begun to link patterns of brain activity and connectivity to behavior inASD. METHOD: We examined regional eyes_closed and eyes_open EEG alpha power andcoherence at rest in relation to self_reported perceptual and social behavior in15 adults diagnosed with ASD and a matched comparison group of 16 unimpairedadults. RESULTS: The groups did not differ on eyes_closed EEG alpha power orcoherence, but adults with ASD showed less alpha suppression for the eyes_opencondition than did controls. In the ASD group, preferential attention to detail(perceptual domain) was associated with lower levels of alpha activity andreduced coherence in posterior regions. No relations between social interactiondifficulties (social domain) and alpha measures were found for either groupalone. CONCLUSIONS: These relations suggest that the processing of perceptualdetails may be carried out by relatively less synchronized neuronal units inadults with ASD, and may be relatively automatic. SIGNIFICANCE: Findings arediscussed in relation to recent models of narrow minicolumnar brain structure andreduced functional neural connectivity in ASD.\n",
      "Title:  Autism as a neural systems disorder: a theory of frontal_posteriorunderconnectivity.\n",
      "Abstract:  The underconnectivity theory of autism attributes the disorder to loweranatomical and functional systems connectivity between frontal and more posteriorcortical processing. Here we review evidence for the theory and present acomputational model of an executive functioning task (Tower of London)implementing the assumptions of underconnectivity. We make two modifications to aprevious computational account of performance and brain activity in typicalindividuals in the Tower of London task (Newman et al., 2003): (1) thecommunication bandwidth between frontal and parietal areas was decreased and (2)the posterior centers were endowed with more executive capability (i.e., moreautonomy, an adaptation is proposed to arise in response to the loweredfrontal_posterior bandwidth). The autism model succeeds in matching the lowerfrontal_posterior functional connectivity (lower synchronization of activation)seen in fMRI data, as well as providing insight into behavioral response timeresults. The theory provides a unified account of how a neural dysfunction canproduce a neural systems disorder and a psychological disorder with thewidespread and diverse symptoms of autism.\n",
      "Title:  Developmental maturation of dynamic causal control signals in higher_ordercognition: a neurocognitive network model.\n",
      "Abstract:  Cognitive skills undergo protracted developmental changes resulting inproficiencies that are a hallmark of human cognition. One skill that developsover time is the ability to problem solve, which in turn relies on cognitivecontrol and attention abilities. Here we use a novel multimodal neurocognitivenetwork_based approach combining task_related fMRI, resting_state fMRI anddiffusion tensor imaging (DTI) to investigate the maturation of control processesunderlying problem solving skills in 7_9 year_old children. Our analysis focusedon two key neurocognitive networks implicated in a wide range of cognitive tasksincluding control: the insula_cingulate salience network, anchored in anteriorinsula (AI), ventrolateral prefrontal cortex and anterior cingulate cortex, andthe fronto_parietal central executive network, anchored in dorsolateralprefrontal cortex and posterior parietal cortex (PPC). We found that, by age 9,the AI node of the salience network is a major causal hub initiating controlsignals during problem solving. Critically, despite stronger AI activation, thestrength of causal regulatory influences from AI to the PPC node of the centralexecutive network was significantly weaker and contributed to lower levels ofbehavioral performance in children compared to adults. These results werevalidated using two different analytic methods for estimating causal interactionsin fMRI data. In parallel, DTI_based tractography revealed weaker AI_PPCstructural connectivity in children. Our findings point to a crucial role of AIconnectivity, and its causal cross_network influences, in the maturation ofdynamic top_down control signals underlying cognitive development. Overall, ourstudy demonstrates how a unified neurocognitive network model when combined withmultimodal imaging enhances our ability to generalize beyond individualtask_activated foci and provides a common framework for elucidating key featuresof brain and cognitive development. The quantitative approach developed is likelyto be useful in investigating neurodevelopmental disorders, in which controlprocesses are impaired, such as autism and ADHD.\n",
      "Title:  Neural systems for speech and song in autism.\n",
      "Abstract:  Despite language disabilities in autism, music abilities are frequentlypreserved. Paradoxically, brain regions associated with these functions typicallyoverlap, enabling investigation of neural organization supporting speech and songin autism. Neural systems sensitive to speech and song were compared inlow_functioning autistic and age_matched control children using passive auditorystimulation during functional magnetic resonance and diffusion tensor imaging.Activation in left inferior frontal gyrus was reduced in autistic childrenrelative to controls during speech stimulation, but was greater than controlsduring song stimulation. Functional connectivity for song relative to speech wasalso increased between left inferior frontal gyrus and superior temporal gyrus inautism, and large_scale connectivity showed increased frontal_posteriorconnections. Although fractional anisotropy of the left arcuate fasciculus wasdecreased in autistic children relative to controls, structural terminations ofthe arcuate fasciculus in inferior frontal gyrus were indistinguishable betweenautistic and control groups. Fractional anisotropy correlated with activity inleft inferior frontal gyrus for both speech and song conditions. Together, thesefindings indicate that in autism, functional systems that process speech and songwere more effectively engaged for song than for speech and projections ofstructural pathways associated with these functions were not distinguishable fromcontrols.\n",
      "Title:  Functional anatomy of cortical areas characterized by Von Economo neurons.\n",
      "Abstract:  Von Economo's neurons (VENs) are large, bipolar or corkscrew_shaped neuronslocated in layers III and V of the frontoinsular and the anterior cingulatecortices. VENs are reported to be altered in pathologies such as frontotemporaldementia and autism, in which the individual's self control is seriouslycompromised. To investigate the role of VENs in the active human brain, we haveexplored the functional connectivity of brain areas containing VENs by analyzingresting state functional connectivity (rsFC) in 20 healthy volunteers. Ourresults show that cortical areas containing VENs form a network of frontoparietalfunctional connectivity. With the use of fuzzy clustering techniques, we findthat this network comprises four sub_networks: the first network clusterresembles a \"saliency detection\" attentional network, which includes superiorfrontal cortex (Brodmann's Area, BA 10), inferior parietal lobe, anterior insula,and dorsal anterior cingulate cortex; the second cluster, part of a\"sensory_motor network\", comprises the superior temporal, precentral andpostcentral areas; the third cluster consists of frontal ventromedial andventrodorsal areas constituted by parts of the \"anterior default mode network\";and the fourth cluster encompasses dorsal anterior cingulate cortex, dorsomedialprefrontal, and superior frontal (BA 10) areas, resembling the anterior part ofthe \"dorsal attentional network\". Thus, the network that emerges from analyzingfunctional connectivity among areas that are known to contain VENs is primarilyinvolved in functions of saliency detection and self_regulation. In addition,parts of this network constitute sub_networks that partially overlap with thedefault mode, the sensory_motor and the dorsal attentional networks.\n",
      "Title:  Altered functional and structural brain network organization in autism.\n",
      "Abstract:  Structural and functional underconnectivity have been reported for multiple brainregions, functional systems, and white matter tracts in individuals with autismspectrum disorders (ASD). Although recent developments in complex networkanalysis have established that the brain is a modular network exhibitingsmall_world properties, network level organization has not been carefullyexamined in ASD. Here we used resting_state functional MRI (n = 42 ASD, n = 37typically developing; TD) to show that children and adolescents with ASD displayreduced short and long_range connectivity within functional systems (i.e.,reduced functional integration) and stronger connectivity between functionalsystems (i.e., reduced functional segregation), particularly in default andhigher_order visual regions. Using graph theoretical methods, we show thatpairwise group differences in functional connectivity are reflected in networklevel reductions in modularity and clustering (local efficiency), but shortercharacteristic path lengths (higher global efficiency). Structural networks,generated from diffusion tensor MRI derived fiber tracts (n = 51 ASD, n = 43 TD),displayed lower levels of white matter integrity yet higher numbers of fibers. TDand ASD individuals exhibited similar levels of correlation between raw measuresof structural and functional connectivity (n = 35 ASD, n = 35 TD). However, aprincipal component analysis combining structural and functional networkproperties revealed that the balance of local and global efficiency betweenstructural and functional networks was reduced in ASD, positively correlated withage, and inversely correlated with ASD symptom severity. Overall, our findingssuggest that modeling the brain as a complex network will be highly informativein unraveling the biological basis of ASD and other neuropsychiatric disorders.\n",
      "Title:  The impact of serotonin transporter genotype on default network connectivity inchildren and adolescents with autism spectrum disorders.\n",
      "Abstract:  Compared to healthy controls, individuals with autism spectrum disorders (ASD)have weaker posterior_anterior connectivity that strengthens less with age withinthe default network, a set of brain structures connected in the absence of a taskand likely involved in social function. The serotonin transporter_linkedpolymorphic region (5_HTTLPR) genotypes that result in lowered serotonintransporter expression are associated with social impairment in ASD.Additionally, in healthy controls, low expressing 5_HTTLPR genotypes areassociated with weaker default network connectivity. However, in ASD, the effectof 5_HTTLPR on the default network is unknown. We hypothesized that 5_HTTLPR'sinfluence on posterior_anterior default network connectivity strength as well ason age_related changes in connectivity differs in the ASD group versus controls.Youth with ASD and healthy controls, ages 8_19, underwent a resting fMRIacquisition. Connectivity was calculated by correlating the posterior hub of thedefault network with all voxels. Triallelic genotype was assessed via PCR andSanger sequencing. A genotype_by_diagnosis interaction significantly predictedposterior_anterior connectivity, such that low expressing genotypes (S/S, S/LG,LG/LG) were associated with stronger connectivity than high expressing genotypes(LA/LA, S/LA, LA/LG) in the ASD group, but the converse was true for controls.Also, youth with ASD and low expressing genotypes had greater age_relatedincreases in connectivity values compared to those with high expressing genotypesand controls in either genotype group. Our findings suggest that the cascade ofevents from genetic variation to brain function differs in ASD. Also, lowexpressing genotypes may represent a subtype within ASD.\n",

      "Abstract:  Recent research revealed decreased access to semantic and associative networks inacute cocaine withdrawal. In autism, such behavioral outcomes are associated withdecreased functional connectivity using functional magnetic resonance imaging.Therefore, we wished to determine whether connectivity is also decreased in acutecocaine withdrawal. Eight subjects in acute cocaine withdrawal were compared tocontrols for connectivity in language areas while performing a task involvingcategorization of words according to semantic and phonological relatedness. Acutewithdrawal subjects had significantly less overall connectivity during semanticrelatedness, and a trend towards less connectivity during phonologicalrelatedness. Of potential future interest is whether this might serve as animaging marker for treatment in patients.\n",
      "Title:  The impact of serotonin transporter (5_HTTLPR) genotype on the development ofresting_state functional connectivity in children and adolescents: a preliminaryreport.\n",
      "Abstract:  A fundamental component of brain development is the formation of large_scalenetworks across the cortex. One such network, the default network, undergoes aprotracted development, displaying weak connectivity in childhood thatstrengthens in adolescence and becomes most robust in adulthood. Little is knownabout the genetic contributions to default network connectivity in adulthood orduring development. Alterations in connectivity between posterior and frontalportions of the default network have been associated with several psychologicaldisorders, including anxiety, autism spectrum disorders, schizophrenia,depression, and attention_deficit/hyperactivity disorder. These disorders havealso been linked to variants of the serotonin transporter linked polymorphicregion (5_HTTLPR). The LA allele of 5_HTTLPR results in higher serotonintransporter expression than the S allele or the rarer LG allele. 5_HTTLPR mayinfluence default network connectivity, as the superior medial frontal region hasbeen shown to be sensitive to changes in serotonin. Also, serotonin as a growthfactor early in development may alter large_scale networks such as the defaultnetwork. The present study examined the influence of 5_HTTLPR variants onconnectivity between the posterior and frontal structures and its development ina cross_sectional study of 39 healthy children and adolescents. We found thatchildren and adolescents homozygous for the S allele (S/S, n=10) showed weakerconnectivity in the superior medial frontal cortex compared to those homozygousfor the LA allele (LA/LA, n=13) or heterozygotes (S/LA, S/LG, n=16). Moreover,there was an age_by_genotype interaction, such that those with LA/LA genotype hadthe steepest age_related increase in connectivity between the posterior hub andsuperior medial frontal cortex, followed by heterozygotes. In contrast,individuals with the S/S genotype had the least age_related increase inconnectivity strength. This preliminary report expands our understanding of thegenetic influences on the development of large_scale brain connectivity and laysdown the foundation for future research and replication of the results with alarger sample.\n",
      "Title:  Disrupted cortical connectivity theory as an explanatory model for autismspectrum disorders.\n",
      "Abstract:  Recent findings of neurological functioning in autism spectrum disorder (ASD)point to altered brain connectivity as a key feature of its pathophysiology. Thecortical underconnectivity theory of ASD (Just et al., 2004) provides anintegrated framework for addressing these new findings. This theory suggests thatweaker functional connections among brain areas in those with ASD hamper theirability to accomplish complex cognitive and social tasks successfully. We willdiscuss this theory, but will modify the term underconnectivity to 'disruptedand over_connectivityin the brain. In this paper, we will review the existing literature on ASD tomarshal supporting evidence for hypotheses formulated on the disrupted corticalconnectivity theory. These hypotheses are: 1) underconnectivity in ASD ismanifested mainly in long_distance cortical as well as subcortical connectionsrather than in short_distance cortical connections; 2) underconnectivity in ASDis manifested only in complex cognitive and social functions and not in low_levelsensory and perceptual tasks; 3) functional underconnectivity in ASD may be theresult of underlying anatomical abnormalities, such as problems in the integrityof white matter; 4) the ASD brain adapts to underconnectivity throughcompensatory strategies such as overconnectivity mainly in frontal and inposterior brain areas. This may be manifested as deficits in tasks that requirefrontal_parietal integration. While overconnectivity can be tested by examiningthe cortical minicolumn organization, long_distance underconnectivity can betested by cognitively demanding tasks; and 5) functional underconnectivity inbrain areas in ASD will be seen not only during complex tasks but also duringtask_free resting states. We will also discuss some empirical predictions thatcan be tested in future studies, such as: 1) how disrupted connectivity relatesto cognitive impairments in skills such as Theory_of_Mind, cognitive flexibility,and information processing; and 2) how connection abnormalities relate to, andmay determine, behavioral symptoms hallmarked by the triad of Impairments in ASD.Furthermore, we will relate the disrupted cortical connectivity model to existingcognitive and neural models of ASD.\n",
      "Title:  Functional connectivity magnetic resonance imaging classification of autism.\n",
      "Abstract:  Group differences in resting state functional magnetic resonance imagingconnectivity between individuals with autism and typically developing controlshave been widely replicated for a small number of discrete brain regions, yet thewhole_brain distribution of connectivity abnormalities in autism is not wellcharacterized. It is also unclear whether functional connectivity is sufficientlyrobust to be used as a diagnostic or prognostic metric in individual patientswith autism. We obtained pairwise functional connectivity measurements from alattice of 7266 regions of interest covering the entire grey matter (26.4 millionconnections) in a well_characterized set of 40 male adolescents and young adultsand IQ_matched typically developing subjects. Asingle resting state blood oxygen level_dependent scan of 8 min was used for theclassification in each subject. A leave_one_out classifier successfullydistinguished autism from control subjects with 83% sensitivity and 75%specificity for a total accuracy of 79% (P = 1.1 x 10(_7)). In subjects <20 yearsof age, the classifier performed at 89% accuracy (P = 5.4 x 10(_7)). In areplication dataset consisting of 21 individuals from six families with bothaffected and unaffected siblings, the classifier performed at 71% accuracy (91%accuracy for subjects <20 years of age). Classification scores in subjects withautism were significantly correlated with the Social Responsiveness Scale (P =0.05), verbal IQ (P = 0.02) and the Autism Diagnostic ObservationSchedule_Generic's combined social and communication subscores (P = 0.05). Ananalysis of informative connections demonstrated that region of interest pairswith strongest correlation values were most abnormal in autism. Negativelycorrelated region of interest pairs showed higher correlation in autism (lessanticorrelation), possibly representing weaker inhibitory connections,particularly for long connections (Euclidean distance >10 cm). Brain regionsshowing greatest differences included regions of the default mode network,superior parietal lobule, fusiform gyrus and anterior insula. Overall,classification accuracy was better for younger subjects, with differences betweenautism and control subjects diminishing after 19 years of age. Classificationscores of unaffected siblings of individuals with autism were more similar tothose of the control subjects than to those of the subjects with autism. Thesefindings indicate feasibility of a functional connectivity magnetic resonanceimaging diagnostic assay for autism.\n",
      "Title:  Probing the brain in autism using FMRI and diffusion tensor imaging.\n",
      "Abstract:  Newly emerging theories suggest that the brain does not function as a cohesiveunit in autism, and this discordance is reflected in the behavioral symptomsdisplayed by individuals with autism. While structural neuroimaging findings haveprovided some insights into brain abnormalities in autism, the consistency ofsuch findings is questionable. Functional neuroimaging, on the other hand, hasbeen more fruitful in this regard because autism is a disorder of dynamicprocessing and allows examination of communication between cortical networks,which appears to be where the underlying problem occurs in autism. Functionalconnectivity is defined as the temporal correlation of spatially separateneurological events. Findings from a number of recent fMRI studies have supportedthe idea that there is weaker coordination between different parts of the brainthat should be working together to accomplish complex social or languageproblems. One of the mysteries of autism is the coexistence of deficits inseveral domains along with relatively intact, sometimes enhanced, abilities. Suchcomplex manifestation of autism calls for a global and comprehensive examinationof the disorder at the neural level. A compelling recent account of the brainfunctioning in autism, the cortical underconnectivity theory, provides anintegrating framework for the neurobiological bases of autism. The corticalunderconnectivity theory of autism suggests that any language, social, orpsychological function that is dependent on the integration of multiple brainregions is susceptible to disruption as the processing demand increases. Inautism, the underfunctioning of integrative circuitry in the brain may causewidespread underconnectivity. In other words, people with autism may interpretinformation in a piecemeal fashion at the expense of the whole. Since corticalunderconnectivity among brain regions, especially the frontal cortex and moreposterior areas, has now been relatively well established, we can begin tofurther understand brain connectivity as a critical component of autismsymptomatology. A logical next step in this direction is to examine theanatomical connections that may mediate the functional connections mentionedabove. Diffusion Tensor Imaging (DTI) is a relatively novel neuroimagingtechnique that helps probe the diffusion of water in the brain to infer theintegrity of white matter fibers. In this technique, water diffusion in the brainis examined in several directions using diffusion gradients. While functionalconnectivity provides information about the synchronization of brain activationacross different brain areas during a task or during rest, DTI helps inunderstanding the underlying axonal organization which may facilitate thecross_talk among brain areas. This paper will describe these techniques asvaluable tools in understanding the brain in autism and the challenges involvedin this line of research.\n",
      "Title:  The balance between feeling and knowing: affective and cognitive empathy arereflected in the brain's intrinsic functional dynamics.\n",
      "Abstract:  Affective empathy (AE) is distinguished clinically and neurally from cognitiveempathy (CE). While AE is selectively disrupted in psychopathy, autism isassociated with deficits in CE. Despite such dissociations, AE and CE togethercontribute to normal human empathic experience. A dimensional measure ofindividual differences in AE 'relative to' CE captures this interaction and mayreveal brain_behavior relationships beyond those detectable with AE and CEseparately. Using resting_state fMRI and measures of empathy in healthy adults,we show that relative empathic ability (REA) is reflected in the brain'sintrinsic functional dynamics. Dominance of AE was associated with strongerfunctional connectivity among social_emotional regions (ventral anterior insula,orbitofrontal cortex, amygdala, perigenual anterior cingulate). Dominance of CEwas related to stronger connectivity among areas implicated in interoception,autonomic monitoring and social_cognitive processing (brainstem, superiortemporal sulcus, ventral anterior insula). These patterns were distinct fromthose observed with AE and CE separately. Finally, REA and the strength ofseveral functional connections were associated with symptoms of psychopathology.These findings suggest that REA provides a dimensional index of empathic functionand pathological tendencies in healthy adults, which are reflected in theintrinsic functional dynamics of neural systems associated with social andemotional cognition.\n",

      "Abstract:  A growing body of evidence suggests that autism spectrum disorders (ASDs) arerelated to altered communication between brain regions. Here, we present findingsshowing that ASD is characterized by a pattern of reduced functional integrationas well as reduced segregation of large_scale brain networks. Twenty_threechildren with ASD and 25 typically developing matched controls underwentfunctional magnetic resonance imaging while passively viewing emotional faceexpressions. We examined whole_brain functional connectivity of two brainstructures previously implicated in emotional face processing in autism: theamygdala bilaterally and the right pars opercularis of the inferior frontal gyrus(rIFGpo). In the ASD group, we observed reduced functional integration (i.e.,less long_range connectivity) between amygdala and secondary visual areas, aswell as reduced segregation between amygdala and dorsolateral prefrontal cortex.For the rIFGpo seed, we observed reduced functional integration with parietalcortex and increased integration with right frontal cortex as well as rightnucleus accumbens. Finally, we observed reduced segregation between rIFGpo andthe ventromedial prefrontal cortex. We propose that a systems_levelapproach_whereby the integration and segregation of large_scale brain networks inASD is examined in relation to typical development_may provide a more detailedcharacterization of the neural basis of ASD.\n",

      "Abstract:  The present study aimed to explore the neural correlates of two characteristicdeficits in autism spectrum disorders (ASD); social impairment and restricted,repetitive behavior patterns. To this end, we used comparable experiences ofsocial exclusion and rule violation to probe potentially atypical neural networksin ASD. In children and adolescents with and without ASD, we used the interactiveball_toss game (Cyberball) to elicit social exclusion and a comparable game(Cybershape) to elicit a non_exclusive rule violation. Using functional magneticresonance imaging (fMRI), we identified group differences in brain responses tosocial exclusion and rule violation. Though both groups reported equal distressfollowing exclusion, the right insula and ventral anterior cingulate cortex werehypoactive during exclusion in children with ASD. In rule violation, right insulaand dorsal prefrontal cortex were hyperactive in ASD. Right insula showed adissociation in activation; it was hypoactive to social exclusion and hyperactiveto rule violation in the ASD group. Further probed, different regions of rightinsula were modulated in each game, highlighting differences in regionalspecificity for which subsequent analyses revealed differences in patterns offunctional connectivity. These results demonstrate neurobiological differences inprocessing social exclusion and rule violation in children with ASD.\n",
      "Title:  The neural basis of deictic shifting in linguistic perspective_taking inhigh_functioning autism.\n",
      "Abstract:  Personal pronouns, such as 'I' and 'you', require a speaker/listener tocontinuously re_map their reciprocal relation to their referent, depending on whois saying the pronoun. This process, called 'deictic shifting', may underlie theincorrect production of these pronouns, or 'pronoun reversals', such as referringto oneself with the pronoun 'you', which has been reported in children withautism. The underlying neural basis of deictic shifting, however, is notunderstood, nor has the processing of pronouns been studied in adults withautism. The present study compared the brain activation pattern and functionalconnectivity (synchronization of activation across brain areas) of adults withhigh_functioning autism and control participants using functional magneticresonance imaging in a linguistic perspective_taking task that required deicticshifting. The results revealed significantly diminished frontal (right anteriorinsula) to posterior (precuneus) functional connectivity during deictic shiftingin the autism group, as well as reliably slower and less accurate behaviouralresponses. A comparison of two types of deictic shifting revealed that thefunctional connectivity between the right anterior insula and precuneus was lowerin autism while answering a question that contained the pronoun 'you', queryingsomething about the participant's view, but not when answering a query aboutsomeone else's view. In addition to the functional connectivity between the rightanterior insula and precuneus being lower in autism, activation in each regionwas atypical, suggesting over reliance on individual regions as a potentialcompensation for the lower level of collaborative interregional processing. Thesefindings indicate that deictic shifting constitutes a challenge for adults withhigh_functioning autism, particularly when reference to one's self is involved,and that the functional collaboration of two critical nodes, right anteriorinsula and precuneus, may play a critical role for deictic shifting by supportingan attention shift between oneself and others.\n",

      "Abstract:  This functional magnetic resonance imaging study compared the neural activationpatterns of 18 high_functioning individuals with autism and 18 IQ_matchedneurotypical control participants as they learned to perform a social judgmenttask. Participants learned to identify liars among pairs of computer_animatedavatars uttering the same sentence but with different facial and vocalexpressions, namely those that have previously been associated with lying versustruth_telling. Despite showing a behavioral learning effect similar to thecontrol group, the autism group did not show the same pattern of decreasedactivation in cortical association areas as they learned the task. Furthermore,the autism group showed a significantly smaller increase in interregionsynchronization of activation (functional connectivity) with learning than didthe control group. Finally, the autism group had decreased structuralconnectivity as measured by corpus callosum size, and this measure was reliablyrelated to functional connectivity measures. The findings suggest that corticalunderconnectivity in autism may constrain the ability of the brain to rapidlyadapt during learning.\n",
      "Title:  Functional differentiation of posterior superior temporal sulcus in autism: afunctional connectivity magnetic resonance imaging study.\n",
      "Abstract:  BACKGROUND: Socio_communicative impairments are salient features of autismspectrum disorder (ASD). Abnormal development of posterior superior temporala key processing area for language, biological motion, and socialcould play a role in these deficits. METHODS: Functional connectivitymagnetic resonance imaging was used to examine the synchronization oflow_frequency blood oxygen level_dependent fluctuations during continuousperformance on a visual search task. Twenty_one children and adolescents with ASDand 26 typically developing individuals_matched on age and IQ_participated in thestudy. Three subregions of pSTS were delineated with a data_driven approach, anddifferentiation of pSTS was examined by comparing the connectivity of eachsubregion. RESULTS: In typically developing individuals, differentiation ofnetworks was positively associated with age and anatomical maturation (corticalthinning in pSTS, greater white matter volume). In the ASD group, differentiationof pSTS connectivity was significantly reduced, and correlations with anatomicalmeasures were weak or absent. Moreover, pSTS differentiation was inverselycorrelated with autism symptom severity. CONCLUSIONS: Atypical maturation of pSTSsuggests altered trajectories for functional segregation and integration ofnetworks in ASD, potentially related to impaired cognitive and sensorimotordevelopment. Furthermore, our findings provide a novel explanation for atypicallyincreased connectivity in ASD that has been observed in some functionalconnectivity magnetic resonance imaging studies.\n",
      "Title:  Autonomy of lower_level perception from global processing in autism: evidencefrom brain activation and functional connectivity.\n",
      "Abstract:  Previous behavioral studies have shown that individuals with autism are lesshindered by interference from global processing during the performance oflower_level perceptual tasks, such as finding embedded figures. The primary goalof this study was to examine the brain manifestation of such atypicality inhigh_functioning autism using fMRI. Fifteen participants with high_functioningand IQ_matched typical controls were asked to perform alower_level perceptual line_counting task in the presence of a distractingdepiction of a 3_D object, in which participants counted whether there were morered or more green contours (In a contrasting 3_D task, participants judgedwhether the same 3_D stimulus objects (but without color in any contours)depicted a possible or impossible 3_D object). We hypothesized that individualswith autism would be less likely than controls to process the global 3_Dinformation (and would hence show fewer neural signs of such interfering 3_Dprocessing) during the lower_level line_counting task. The fMRI results revealedthat in the line_counting task, the autism group did not show the increasedmedial frontal activity (relative to the possibility task), or the increasedfunctional connectivity between the medial frontal region and posteriorvisual_spatial regions, demonstrated by the control group. Both findings areindices of lesser effort and difficulty in the line_counting task for the autismgroup than for the control group, attributed to less interference from the 3_Dprocessing in the autism group. In addition, in the line_counting task, thecontrol group showed a positive correlation between a measure of spatial ability(Vandenberg scores) and activation in the medial frontal region, suggesting thatmore spatially able control participants did more suppression of the irrelevant3_D background information in order to focus on the line_counting task. Thefindings collectively indicate that the global 3_D structure of the figure had asmaller effect, if any, on local processing in the group with autism compared tothe control group. The results from this study provide the first direct neuralevidence of reduced global_to_local interference in autism.\n",
      "Title:  Gender differences in brain functional connectivity density.\n",
      "Abstract:  The neural bases of gender differences in emotional, cognitive, and socialbehaviors are largely unknown. Here, magnetic resonance imaging data from 336women and 225 men revealed a gender dimorphism in the functional organization ofthe brain. Consistently across five research sites, women had 14% higher localfunctional connectivity density (lFCD) and up to 5% higher gray matter densitythan men in cortical and subcortical regions. The negative power scaling of thelFCD was steeper for men than for women, suggesting that the balance betweenstrongly and weakly connected nodes in the brain is different across genders. Themore distributed organization of the male brain than that of the female braincould help explain the gender differences in cognitive style and behaviors and inthe prevalence of neuropsychiatric diseases (i.e., autism spectrum disorder).\n",
      "Title:  Inter_regional brain communication and its disturbance in autism.\n",
      "Abstract:  In this review article, we summarize recent progress toward understandingdisturbances in functional and anatomical brain connectivity in autism. Autism isa neurodevelopmental disorder affecting language, social interaction, andrepetitive behaviors. Recent studies have suggested that limitations offrontal_posterior brain connectivity in autism underlie the varied set ofdeficits associated with this disorder. Specifically, the underconnectivitytheory of autism postulates that individuals with autism have a reducedcommunication bandwidth between frontal and posterior cortical areas, whichconstrains the psychological processes that rely on the integrated functioning offrontal and posterior brain networks. This review summarizes the recent findingsof reduced frontal_posterior functional connectivity (synchronization) in autismin a wide variety of high_level tasks, focusing on data from functional magneticresonance imaging studies. It also summarizes the findings of disorderedanatomical connectivity in autism, as measured by a variety of techniques,including distribution of white matter volumes and diffusion tensor imaging. Weconclude with a discussion of the implications of these findings for autism andfuture directions for this line of research.\n",
      "Title:  Underconnected, but how? A survey of functional connectivity MRI studies inautism spectrum disorders.\n",
      "Abstract:  Growing consensus suggests that autism spectrum disorders (ASD) are associatedwith atypical brain networks, thus shifting the focus to the study ofconnectivity. Many functional connectivity studies have reportedunderconnectivity in ASD, but results in others have been divergent. We conducteda survey of 32 functional connectivity magnetic resonance imaging studies of ASDfor numerous methodological variables to distinguish studies supporting generalunderconnectivity (GU) from those not consistent with this hypothesis (NGU).Distinguishing patterns were apparent for several data analysis choices. Thestudy types differed significantly with respect to low_pass filtering, taskregression, and whole_brain field of view. GU studies were more likely to examinetask_driven time series in regions of interest, without the use of low_passfiltering. Conversely, NGU studies mostly applied task regression (for removal ofactivation effects) and low_pass filtering, testing for correlations across thewhole brain. Results thus suggest that underconnectivity findings may becontingent on specific methodological choices. Whereas underconnectivity reflectsreduced efficiency of within_network communication in ASD, diffusely increasedfunctional connectivity can be attributed to impaired experience_drivenmechanisms (e.g., synaptic pruning). Both GU and NGU findings reflect importantaspects of network dysfunction associated with sociocommunicative, cognitive, andsensorimotor impairments in ASD.\n",
      "Title:  Microstructural abnormalities of short_distance white matter tracts in autismspectrum disorder.\n",
      "Abstract:  Recent functional connectivity magnetic resonance imaging and diffusion tensorimaging (DTI) studies have suggested atypical functional connectivity and reducedintegrity of long_distance white matter fibers in autism spectrum disorder (ASD).However, evidence for short_distance white matter fibers is still limited,despite some speculation of potential sparing of local connectivity in ASD.Short_distance U_fibers are an important component of neural networks and arethought to play a crucial role in cognitive function. In the present study, weand long_distance whitematter tracts in frontal, parietal, and temporal lobes in both hemispheres. DTIdata were acquired from 26 children with ASD and 24 typically developing (TD)children. A mean fractional anisotropy (FA) image was created and thinned torepresent centers of all common tracts. Evidence of compromised short_distancetracts for the ASD group was found in frontal lobe (reduced FA, increased meandiffusivity [MD] and radial diffusivity) as well as in temporal and parietallobes (increased MD and radial diffusivity). Significant positive correlationsbetween age and FA and negative correlations between age and MD and radialdiffusivity were also found for short_distance tracts in each lobe in the TD, butnot the ASD group. These results suggest white matter compromise inshort_distance tracts in ASD. Absence of typical age_related correlations withDTI indices may reflect altered maturation of short_distance tracts in ASD. Ourresults are inconsistent with a notion of selective sparing of short_distanceconnectivity in ASD.\n",
      "Title:  Aberrant striatal functional connectivity in children with autism.\n",
      "Abstract:  BACKGROUND: Models of autism spectrum disorders (ASD) as neural disconnectionsyndromes have been predominantly supported by examinations of abnormalities incorticocortical networks in adults with autism. A broader body of researchimplicates subcortical structures, particularly the striatum, in thephysiopathology of autism. Resting state functional magnetic resonance imaginghas revealed detailed maps of striatal circuitry in healthy and psychiatricpopulations and vividly captured maturational changes in striatal circuitryduring typical development. METHODS: Using resting state functional magneticresonance imaging, we examined striatal functional connectivity (FC) in 20children with ASD and 20 typically developing children between the ages of 7.6and 13.5 years. Whole_brain voxelwise statistical maps quantified within_groupstriatal FC and between_group differences for three caudate and three putamenseeds for each hemisphere. RESULTS: Children with ASD mostly exhibited prominentpatterns of ectopic striatal FC (i.e., functional connectivity present in ASD butnot in typically developing children), with increased functional connectivitybetween nearly all striatal subregions and heteromodal associative and limbiccortex previously implicated in the physiopathology of ASD (e.g., insular andright superior temporal gyrus). Additionally, we found striatal functionalhyperconnectivity with the pons, thus expanding the scope of functionalalterations implicated in ASD. Secondary analyses revealed ASD_relatedhyperconnectivity between the pons and insula cortex. CONCLUSIONS: Examination ofFC of striatal networks in children with ASD revealed abnormalities in circuitsinvolving early developing areas, such as the brainstem and insula, with apattern of increased FC in ectopic circuits that likely reflects developmentalderangement rather than immaturity of functional circuits.\n",
      "Title:  A big_world network in ASD: dynamical connectivity analysis reflects a deficit inlong_range connections and an excess of short_range connections.\n",
      "Abstract:  Over the last years, increasing evidence has fuelled the hypothesis that AutismSpectrum Disorder (ASD) is a condition of altered brain functional connectivity.The great majority of these empirical studies relies on functional magneticresonance imaging (fMRI) which has a relatively poor temporal resolution. Only ahandful of studies has examined networks emerging from dynamic coherence at themillisecond resolution and there are no investigations of coherence at the lowestfrequencies in the power spectrum_which has recently been shown to reflectlong_range cortico_cortical connections. Here we used electroencephalography(EEG) to assess dynamic brain connectivity in ASD focusing in the low_frequency(delta) range. We found that connectivity patterns were distinct in ASD andcontrol populations and reflected a double dissociation: ASD subjects lackedlong_range connections, with a most prominent deficit in fronto_occipitalconnections. Conversely, individuals with ASD showed increased short_rangeconnections in lateral_frontal electrodes. This effect between categories showeda consistent parametric dependency: as ASD severity increased, short_rangecoherence was more pronounced and long_range coherence decreased. Theoreticalarguments have been proposed arguing that distinct patterns of connectivity mayresult in networks with different efficiency in transmission of information. Weshow that the networks in ASD subjects have less Clustering coefficient, greaterindicating that the topology of theand greater modularity. Togetherthese results show that delta_band coherence reveal qualitative and quantitativeaspects associated with ASD pathology.\n",
      "Title:  Altered functional connectivity in frontal lobe circuits is associated withvariation in the autism risk gene CNTNAP2.\n",
      "Abstract:  Genetic studies are rapidly identifying variants that shape risk for disorders ofhuman cognition, but the question of how such variants predispose toneuropsychiatric disease remains. Noninvasive human brain imaging allowsassessment of the brain in vivo, and the combination of genetics and imagingphenotypes remains one of the only ways to explore functional genotype_phenotypeassociations in human brain. Common variants in contactin_associated protein_like2 (CNTNAP2), a neurexin superfamily member, have been associated with severalallied neurodevelopmental disorders, including autism and specific languageimpairment, and CNTNAP2 is highly expressed in frontal lobe circuits in thedeveloping human brain. Using functional neuroimaging, we have demonstrated arelationship between frontal lobar connectivity and common genetic variants inCNTNAP2. These data provide a mechanistic link between specific genetic risk forneurodevelopmental disorders and empirical data implicating dysfunction oflong_range connections within the frontal lobe in autism. The convergence betweengenetic findings and cognitive_behavioral models of autism provides evidence thatgenetic variation at CNTNAP2 predisposes to diseases such as autism in partthrough modulation of frontal lobe connectivity.\n",
      "Title:  Using a self_organizing map algorithm to detect age_related changes in functionalconnectivity during rest in autism spectrum disorders.\n",
      "Abstract:  Healthy individuals show robust functional connectivity during rest, which isstronger in adults than in children. Connectivity occurs between the posteriorand anterior portions of the default network, a group of structures active in theabsence of a task, including the posterior cingulate cortex and the superiorfrontal gyrus. Previous studies found weaker posterior_anterior connectivity inthe default network in adults and adolescents with autism spectrum disorders(ASD). However, these studies used small a priori regions of interest (\"seeds\")to calculate connectivity. Since seed location for all participants was chosenbased on controls' brains, these studies' analyses are more tailored to controlsthan individuals with ASD. An alternative is to use a data_driven approach, suchas self_organizing maps (SOM), to create a reference for each participant tocalculate connectivity. We used individualized resting_state clusters identifiedby an SOM algorithm to corroborate previous findings of weaker posterior_anteriorconnectivity in the ASD group and examine age_related changes in the ASD andcontrol groups. Thirty_nine adolescents with ASD and 41 controls underwent a10_minute, eyes_open, resting_state functional MRI scan. The SOM analysisrevealed that adolescents with ASD versus controls have weaker connectivitybetween the posterior hub of the default network and the right superior frontalgyrus. Additionally, controls have larger increases in connectivity with agecompared to the ASD group. These findings indicate that SOM is a complementarymethod for calculating connectivity in a clinical population. Additionally,adolescents with ASD have a different developmental trajectory of the defaultnetwork compared to controls.\n",
      "Title:  Pervasive microstructural abnormalities in autism: a DTI study.\n",
      "Abstract:  BACKGROUND: Recent studies have reported abnormal functional connectivitypatterns in the brains of people with autism that may be accompanied by decreasesin white matter integrity. Since autism is a developmental disorder, we aim toinvestigate the nature and location of decreases in white and grey matterintegrity in an adolescent sample while accounting for age. METHODS: We usedstructural (T1) imaging to study brain volumetrics and diffusion tensor imaging(DTI) to investigate white and grey matter integrity in people with autism. Weobtained magnetic resonance images for adolescents aged 12_18 years withhigh_functioning autism and from matched controls. Fractional anisotropy and meandiffusivity, as well as grey and white matter volumetrics were analyzed. RESULTS:There were 17 participants with autism and 25 matched controls included in thisstudy. Participants with autism had lower fractional anisotropy in the left andright superior and inferior longitudinal fasciculus, but this effect was notsignificant after adjusting for age and intelligence quotient (IQ). The kurtosisof the white matter fractional anisotropy probability distribution was higher inthis participant group, with and without adjustment for age and IQ. Most notably,however, the mean diffusivity levels were markedly increased in the autism groupthroughout the brain, and the mean diffusivity probability distributions of bothgrey and white matter were shifted toward a higher value, particularly with ageand IQ adjustment. No volumetric differences in grey and white matter were found.LIMITATIONS: We corrected for age and IQ using a linear model. The study was alsolimited by its sample size, investigated age range and cross_sectional design.CONCLUSION: The findings suggest that autism is characterized by a generalizedreduction of white matter integrity that is associated with an increase ofinterstitial space. The generalized manifestation of the white matterabnormalities provides an important new perspective on autism as a connectivitydisorder.\n",
      "Title:  Decreased interhemispheric functional connectivity in autism.\n",
      "Abstract:  The cortical underconnectivity theory asserts that reduced long_range functionalconnectivity might contribute to a neural mechanism for autism. We examinedresting_state blood oxygen level_dependent interhemispheric correlation in 53males with high_functioning autism and 39 typically developing males from latechildhood through early adulthood. By constructing spatial maps of correlationbetween homologous voxels in each hemisphere, we found significantly reducedinterhemispheric correlation specific to regions with functional relevance toautism: sensorimotor cortex, anterior insula, fusiform gyrus, superior temporalgyrus, and superior parietal lobule. Observed interhemispheric connectivitydifferences were better explained by diagnosis of autism than by potentiallyconfounding neuropsychological metrics of language, IQ, or handedness. Althoughboth corpus callosal volume and gray matter interhemispheric connectivity weresignificantly reduced in autism, no direct relationship was observed betweenthem, suggesting that structural and functional metrics measure different aspectsof interhemispheric connectivity. In the control but not the autism sample, therewas decreasing interhemispheric correlation with subject age. Greater differencesin interhemispheric correlation were seen for more lateral regions in the brain.These findings suggest that long_range connectivity abnormalities in autism arespatially heterogeneous and that transcallosal connectivity is decreased most inregions with functions associated with behavioral abnormalities in autism. Autismsubjects continue to show developmental differences in interhemisphericconnectivity into early adulthood.\n",
      "Title:  Cortical underconnectivity coupled with preserved visuospatial cognition inautism: Evidence from an fMRI study of an embedded figures task.\n",
      "Abstract:  Individuals with high_functioning autism sometimes exhibit intact or superiorperformance on visuospatial tasks, in contrast to impaired functioning in otherdomains such as language comprehension, executive tasks, and social functions.The goal of the current study was to investigate the neural bases of preservedvisuospatial processing in high_functioning autism from the perspective of thecortical underconnectivity theory. We used a combination of behavioral,functional magnetic resonance imaging, functional connectivity, and corpuscallosum morphometric methodological tools. Thirteen participants withhigh_functioning autism and 13 controls (age_, IQ_, and gender_matched) werescanned while performing an Embedded Figures Task. Despite the ability of theautism group to attain behavioral performance comparable to the control group,the brain imaging results revealed several group differences consistent with thecortical underconnectivity account of autism. First, relative to controls, theautism group showed less activation in the left dorsolateral prefrontal andinferior parietal areas and more activation in visuospatial (bilateral superiorparietal extending to inferior parietal and right occipital) areas. Second, theautism group demonstrated lower functional connectivity between higher_orderworking memory/executive areas and visuospatial regions (between frontal andparietal_occipital). Third, the size of the corpus callosum (an index ofanatomical connectivity) was positively correlated with frontal_posterior(parietal and occipital) functional connectivity in the autism group. Thus, evenin the visuospatial domain, where preserved performance among people with autismis observed, the neuroimaging signatures of cortical underconnectivity persist.\n",
      "Title:  Altered intrinsic functional connectivity of anterior and posterior insularegions in high_functioning participants with autism spectrum disorder.\n",
      "Abstract:  Impaired understanding of others' sensations and emotions as well as abnormalexperience of their own emotions and sensations is frequently reported inindividuals with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD). It is hypothesized that theseabnormalities are based on altered connectivity within \"shared\" neural networksinvolved in emotional awareness of self and others. The insula is considered acentral brain region in a network underlying these functions, being located atthe transition of information about bodily arousal and the physiological state ofthe body to subjective feelings. The present study investigated the intrinsicfunctional connectivity properties of the insula in 14 high_functioningparticipants with ASD (HF_ASD) and 15 typically developing (TD) participants inthe age range between 12 and 20 years by means of \"resting state\" or \"nontask\"functional magnetic resonance imaging. Essentially, a distinction was madebetween anterior and posterior regions of the insular cortex. The results show areduced functional connectivity in the HF_ASD group, compared with the TD group,between anterior as well as posterior insula and specific brain regions involvedin emotional and sensory processing. It is suggested that functionalabnormalities in a network involved in emotional and interoceptive awarenessmight be at the basis of altered emotional experiences and impaired socialabilities in ASD, and that these abnormalities are partly based on the intrinsicfunctional connectivity properties of such a network.\n",
      "Title:  Typical and atypical development of functional human brain networks: insightsfrom resting_state FMRI.\n",
      "Abstract:  Over the past several decades, structural MRI studies have provided remarkableinsights into human brain development by revealing the trajectory of gray andwhite matter maturation from childhood to adolescence and adulthood. In parallel,functional MRI studies have demonstrated changes in brain activation patternsaccompanying cognitive development. Despite these advances, studying thematuration of functional brain networks underlying brain development continues topresent unique scientific and methodological challenges. Resting_state fMRI(rsfMRI) has emerged as a novel method for investigating the development oflarge_scale functional brain networks in infants and young children. We reviewexisting rsfMRI developmental studies and discuss how this method has begun tomake significant contributions to our understanding of maturing brainorganization. In particular, rsfMRI has been used to complement studies in othermodalities investigating the emergence of functional segregation and integrationacross short and long_range connections spanning the entire brain. We show thatrsfMRI studies help to clarify and reveal important principles of functionalbrain development, including a shift from diffuse to focal activation patterns,and simultaneous pruning of local connectivity and strengthening of long_rangeconnectivity with age. The insights gained from these studies also shed light onpotentially disrupted functional networks underlying atypical cognitivedevelopment associated with neurodevelopmental disorders. We conclude byidentifying critical gaps in the current literature, discussing methodologicalissues, and suggesting avenues for future research.\n",
      "Title:  Atypical network connectivity for imitation in autism spectrum disorder.\n",
      "Abstract:  Imitation has been considered as one of the precursors for sociocommunicativedevelopment. Impairments of imitation in autism spectrum disorder (ASD) could beindicative of dysfunctional underlying neural processes. Neuroimaging studieshave found reduced activation in areas associated with imitation, but afunctional connectivity MRI network perspective of these regions in autism isunavailable. Functional and effective connectivity was examined in 14 maleparticipants with ASD and 14 matched typically developing (TD) participants. Weanalyzed intrinsic, low_frequency blood oxygen level dependent (BOLD)fluctuations of three regions in literature found to be associated with imitation(inferior frontal gyrus [IFG], inferior parietal lobule [IPL], superior temporalsulcus [STS]). Direct group comparisons did not show significantly reducedfunctional connectivity within the imitation network in ASD. Conversely, weobserved greater connectivity with frontal regions, particularly superior frontaland anterior cingulate gyri, in the ASD compared to TD group. Structural equationmodeling of effective connectivity revealed a significantly reduced effect of IPLon IFG together with an increased influence of a region in dorsal prefrontalcortex (dPFC) on IFG in the ASD group. Our results suggest atypical connectivityof the imitation network with an enhanced role of dPFC, which may relate tobehavioral impairments.\n",
      "Title:  Effect of propranolol on functional connectivity in autism spectrum disorder_pilot study.\n",
      "Abstract:  A decrease in interaction between brain regions is observed in individuals withautism spectrum disorder (ASD), which is believed to be related to restrictedneural network access in ASD. Propranolol, a beta_adrenergic antagonist, hasrevealed benefit during performance of tasks involving flexibility of access tonetworks, a benefit also seen in ASD. Our goal was to determine the effect ofpropranolol on functional connectivity in ASD during a verbal decision makingtask as compared to nadolol, thereby accounting for the potential spurious fMRIeffects due to peripheral hemodynamic effects of propranolol. Ten ASD subjectsunderwent fMRI scans after administration of placebo, propranolol or nadolol,while performing a phonological decision making task. Comparison of functionalconnectivity between pre_defined ROI_pairs revealed a significant increase withpropranolol compared to nadolol, suggesting a potential imaging marker for thecognitive effects of propranolol in ASD.\n",
      "Title:  Is the ADHD brain wired differently? A review on structural and functionalconnectivity in attention deficit hyperactivity disorder.\n",
      "Abstract:  In recent years, a change in perspective in etiological models of attentiondeficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) has occurred in concordance with emergingconcepts in other neuropsychiatric disorders such as schizophrenia and autism.These models shift the focus of the assumed pathology from regional brainabnormalities to dysfunction in distributed network organization. In the currentcontribution, we report findings from functional connectivity studies duringresting and task states, as well as from studies on structural connectivity usingdiffusion tensor imaging, in subjects with ADHD. Although major methodologicallimitations in analyzing connectivity measures derived from noninvasive in vivoneuroimaging still exist, there is convergent evidence for white matter pathologyand disrupted anatomical connectivity in ADHD. In addition, dysfunctionalconnectivity during rest and during cognitive tasks has been demonstrated.However, the causality between disturbed white matter architecture and corticaldysfunction remains to be evaluated. Both genetic and environmental factors mightcontribute to disruptions in interactions between different brain regions.Stimulant medication not only modulates regionally specific activation strengthbut also normalizes dysfunctional connectivity, pointing to a predominant networkdysfunction in ADHD. By combining a longitudinal approach with a systemsperspective in ADHD in the future, it might be possible to identify at whichstage during development disruptions in neural networks emerge and to delineatepossible new endophenotypes of ADHD.\n",

      "Abstract:  Functional MRI (fMRI), a tool increasingly used to study cognitive function, isalso an important tool for understanding not only normal development in healthychildren, but also abnormal development, as seen in children with epilepsy,attention_deficit/hyperactivity disorder, and autism. Since its inception almost15 years ago, fMRI has seen an explosion in its use and applications in the adultliterature. However, only recently has it found a home in pediatric neurology.New adaptations in study design and technologic advances, especially the study ofresting state functional connectivity as well as the use of passive task designin sedated children, have increased the utility of functional imaging inpediatrics to help us gain understanding into the developing brain at work.

      "Title:  Reduced cognitive control of response inhibition by the anterior cingulate cortexin autism spectrum disorders.\n",
      "Abstract:  Response inhibition, or the suppression of prepotent, but contextuallyinappropriate behaviors, is essential to adaptive, flexible responding. In autismspectrum disorders (ASD), difficulty inhibiting prepotent behaviors maycontribute to restricted, repetitive behavior (RRB). Individuals with ASDconsistently show deficient response inhibition while performing antisaccades,which require one to inhibit the prepotent response of looking towards a suddenlyappearing stimulus (i.e., a prosaccade), and to substitute a gaze in the oppositedirection. Here, we used fMRI to identify the neural correlates of this deficit.We focused on two regions that are critical for saccadic inhibition: the frontaleye field (FEF), the key cortical region for generating volitional saccades, andthe dorsal anterior cingulate cortex (dACC), which is thought to exert top_downcontrol on the FEF. We also compared ASD and control groups on the functionalconnectivity of the dACC and FEF during saccadic performance. In the context ofan increased antisaccade error rate, ASD participants showed decreased functionalconnectivity of the FEF and dACC and decreased inhibition_related activation(based on the contrast of antisaccades and prosaccades) in both regions.Decreased dACC activation correlated with a higher error rate in both groups,consistent with a role in top_down control. Within the ASD group, increased FEFactivation and dACC/FEF functional connectivity were associated with more severeRRB. These findings demonstrate functional abnormalities in a circuit criticalfor volitional ocular motor control in ASD that may contribute to deficientresponse inhibition and to RRB. More generally, our findings suggest reducedcognitive control over behavior by the dACC in ASD.\n",

      "Abstract:  Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and functional connectivity MRI(fcMRI) studies of autism spectrum disorders (ASD) have suggested atypicalpatterns of activation and long_distance connectivity for diverse tasks andnetworks in ASD. We explored the regional homogeneity (ReHo) approach in ASD,which is analogous to conventional fcMRI, but focuses on local connectivity. FMRIdata of 26 children with ASD and 29 typically developing (TD) children wereacquired during continuous task performance (visual search). Effects of motionand task were removed and Kendall's coefficient of concordance (KCC) wascomputed, based on the correlation of the blood oxygen level dependent (BOLD)time series for each voxel and its six nearest neighbors. ReHo was lower in theASD than the TD group in superior parietal and anterior prefrontal regions.Inverse effects of greater ReHo in the ASD group were detected in lateral andmedial temporal regions, predominantly in the right hemisphere. Our findingssuggest that ReHo is a sensitive measure for detecting cortical abnormalities inautism. However, impact of methodological factors (such as spatial resolution) onReHo require further investigation.\n",

      "Abstract:  INTRODUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT: Impairments in language and communication are adefining feature of autism spectrum disorders. There is significant variabilityin linguistic abilities in autism spectrum disorders. They have difficulties withcertain aspects of language such as semantics functions, syntax, prosody andphonology, although the most evident language deficits concern to pragmaticsfunctioning. These language difficulties can cause serious problems in socialinteraction. CONCLUSIONS: The neural bases underlying this failure to developlanguage are unknown. Several functional and structural imaging studies haveidentified irregularities in language_related regions in autism spectrumdisorders, such as morphometric differences in Broca's area and Wernicke's area,and patterns of reduced or reversed laterality in frontal and temporal cortex.There is also decreased functional connectivity between anterior and posteriorlanguage regions.\n",

      "Abstract:  Phenylketonuria (PKU) is a genetic disorder associated with disruption ofprefrontal cortex (PFC) development and executive dysfunction. To date, however,there is little evidence directly linking these two sequelae of PKU. We utilizedfunctional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to evaluate prefrontal functioningin six individuals with early_treated PKU (ETPKU) during performance of an n_backandgender_matched neurologically intact individuals. In addition, we evaluated thepossible presence of PKU_related disruptions in functional connectivity, as mightbe hypothesized based on prior reports of white matter injury in individuals withETPKU. A number of brain regions, nearly half of which were located in the PFC,were found to show atypical neural activity in individuals with ETPKU duringworking memory performance. We also found decreased connectivity both within thePFC as well as between the PFC and other brain regions in individuals with ETPKUcompared with controls. Results from this preliminary study suggest that bothprefrontal dysfunction and disruptions in functional connectivity may contributeto PKU_related executive impairment. In addition to advancing our understandingof PKU, the current findings have a broader impact in that PKU is regularly usedas a model of early prefrontal dysfunction in the study of otherneurodevelopmental disorders (e.g., autism).\n",

      "Abstract:  PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Functional magnetic resonance imaging studies have had aprofound impact on the delineation of the neurobiologic basis for autism.Advances in fMRI technology for investigating functional connectivity, restingstate connectivity, and a default mode network have provided further detail aboutdisturbances in brain organization and brain_behavior relationships in autism tobe reviewed in this article. RECENT FINDINGS: Recent fMRI studies have providedevidence of enhanced activation and connectivity of posterior, orparietal_occipital, networks and enhanced reliance on visuospatial abilities forvisual and verbal reasoning in high functioning individuals with autism. Evidencealso indicates altered activation in frontostriatal networks for cognitivecontrol, particularly involving anterior cingulate cortex, and alteredconnectivity in the resting state and the default mode network. The findingssuggest that the specialization of many cortical networks of the human brain hasfailed to develop fully in high functioning individuals with autism. SUMMARY:This research provides a growing specification of to the neurobiologic basis forthis complex syndrome and for the co_occurrence of the signs and symptoms as asyndrome. With this knowledge has come new neurobiologically based opportunitiesfor intervention.\n",
      "Title:  Coherent motion processing in autism spectrum disorder (ASD): an fMRI study.\n",
      "Abstract:  A deficit in global motion processing caused by a specific dysfunction of thevisual dorsal pathway has been suggested to underlie perceptual abnormalities insubjects with autism spectrum disorders (ASD). However, the neural mechanismsassociated with abnormal motion processing in ASD remain poorly understood. Weinvestigated brain responses related to the detection of coherent and randomand IQ_matched healthy controls(aged 13_19 years) using event_related functional magnetic resonance imaging(fMRI). Behaviorally, no significant group differences were observed betweensubjects with ASD and controls. Neurally, subjects with ASD showed increasedbrain activation in the left primary visual cortex across all conditions comparedwith controls. A significant interaction effect between group and condition wasobserved in the right superior parietal cortex resulting from increased neuralactivity in the coherent compared with the random motion conditions only in thecontrol group. In addition, neural activity in area V5 was not differentiallymodulated by specific motion conditions in subjects with ASD. Functionalconnectivity analyses revealed positive correlations between the primary visualcortex and area V5 within both hemispheres, but no significant between_groupdifferences in functional connectivity patterns along the dorsal stream. The datasuggest that motion processing in ASD results in deviant activations in both thelower and higher processing stages of the dorsal pathway. This might reflectdifferences in the perception of visual stimuli in ASD, which possibly result inimpaired integration of motion signals.\n",
      "Title:  The neural substrates of action identification.\n",
      "Abstract:  Mentalization is the process by which an observer views a target as possessinghigher cognitive faculties such as goals, intentions and desires. Mentalizationcan be assessed using action identification paradigms, in which observers choosementalistic (goals_focused) or mechanistic (action_focused) descriptions oftargets' actions. Neural structures that play key roles in inferring goals andintentions from others' observed or imagined actions include temporo_parietaljunction, ventral premotor cortex and extrastriate body area. We hypothesizedthat these regions play a role in action identification as well. Data collectedusing functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) confirmed our predictions thatactivity in ventral premotor cortex and middle temporal gyrus near theextrastriate body area varies both as a function of the valence of the target andthe extent to which actions are identified as goal_directed. In addition, theinferior parietal lobule is preferentially engaged when participants identify theactions of mentalized targets. Functional connectivity analyses suggest supportfrom other regions, including the medial prefrontal cortex and amygdala, duringmentalization. We found correlations between action identification and AutismQuotient scores, suggesting that understanding the neural correlates of actionidentification may enhance our understanding of the underpinnings of essentialsocial cognitive processes.\n",
      "Title:  Atypical neural self_representation in autism.\n",
      "Abstract:  The 'self' is a complex multidimensional construct deeply embedded and in manyways defined by our relations with the social world. Individuals with autism areimpaired in both self_referential and other_referential social cognitiveprocessing. Atypical neural representation of the self may be a key tounderstanding the nature of such impairments. Using functional magnetic resonanceimaging we scanned adult males with an autism spectrum condition and age andIQ_matched neurotypical males while they made reflective mentalizing or physicaljudgements about themselves or the British Queen. Neurotypical individualspreferentially recruit the middle cingulate cortex and ventromedial prefrontalcortex in response to self compared with other_referential processing. In autism,ventromedial prefrontal cortex responded equally to self and other, while middlecingulate cortex responded more to other_mentalizing than self_mentalizing. Theseatypical responses occur only in areas where self_information is preferentiallyprocessed and does not affect areas that preferentially respond toother_referential information. In autism, atypical neural self_representation wasalso apparent via reduced functional connectivity between ventromedial prefrontalcortex and areas associated with lower level embodied representations, such asventral premotor and somatosensory cortex. Furthermore, the magnitude of neuralself_other distinction in ventromedial prefrontal cortex was strongly related tothe magnitude of early childhood social impairments in autism. Individuals whoseventromedial prefrontal cortex made the largest distinction between mentalizingabout self and other were least socially impaired in early childhood, while thosewhose ventromedial prefrontal cortex made little to no distinction betweenmentalizing about self and other were the most socially impaired in earlychildhood. These observations reveal that the atypical organization of neuralcircuitry preferentially coding for self_information is a key mechanism at theheart of both self_referential and social impairments in autism.\n",
      "Title:  Alterations of resting state functional connectivity in the default network inadolescents with autism spectrum disorders.\n",
      "Abstract:  Autism spectrum disorders (ASD) are associated with disturbances of neuralconnectivity. Functional connectivity between neural structures is typicallyexamined within the context of a cognitive task, but also exists in the absenceof a task (i.e., \"rest\"). Connectivity during rest is particularly active in aset of structures called the default network, which includes the posteriorcingulate cortex (PCC), retrosplenial cortex, lateral parietal cortex/angulargyrus, medial prefrontal cortex, superior frontal gyrus, temporal lobe, andparahippocampal gyrus. We previously reported that adults with ASD relative tocontrols show areas of stronger and weaker connectivity within the defaultnetwork. The objective of the present study was to examine the default network inadolescents with ASD. Sixteen adolescents with ASD and 15 controls participatedin a functional MRI study. Functional connectivity was examined between a PCCseed and other areas of the default network. Both groups showed connectivity inthe default network. Relative to controls, adolescents with ASD showed widespreadweaker connectivity in nine of the eleven areas of the default network. Moreover,an analysis of symptom severity indicated that poorer social skills and increasesin restricted and repetitive behaviors and interests correlated with weakerconnectivity, whereas poorer verbal and non_verbal communication correlated withstronger connectivity in multiple areas of the default network. These findingsindicate that adolescents with ASD show weaker connectivity in the defaultnetwork than previously reported in adults with ASD. The findings also show thatweaker connectivity within the default network is associated with specificimpairments in ASD.\n",

      "Abstract:  OBJECTIVE: Examination of the EEG photic driving coherence during intermittentphotic stimulation in autistic patients with relatively intact verbal andintellectual functions in order to enhance the likely latent interhemisphericasymmetry in neural connectivity. METHODS: Fourteen autistic boys, aged6_14years, free of drug treatment, with I.Q. 91.4+/_22.8, and 19 normallydeveloping boys were subject to stimulation of 12 fixed frequencies of 3_27Hz.The number of high coherent connections (HCC) (coherence >0.6_0.8) was estimatedamong 7 leads in each hemisphere. RESULTS: In contrast to the spectralcharacteristics showing the right hemisphere deficit in the photic drivingreactivity, the number of HCC differentiated the groups only in the lefthemisphere where it was higher in autistics at the EEG frequencies correspondingto those of stimulation at 6_27Hz without asymmetry at other frequencies, theleft_side prevalence increasing with frequency. No asymmetry was observed in theresting state. CONCLUSIONS: Spectral and coherence characteristics of the EEGphotic driving show different aspects of latent abnormal interhemisphericasymmetry in autistics: the right hemisphere \"hyporeactivity\" and potential\"hyperconectivity\" of likely compensatory nature in the left hemisphere.SIGNIFICANCE: The EEG photic driving can reveal functional topographicalterations not present in the spontaneous EEG.\n",
      "Title:  Sources of group differences in functional connectivity: an investigation appliedto autism spectrum disorder.\n",
      "Abstract:  An increasing number of fMRI studies are using the correlation of low_frequencyfluctuations between brain regions, believed to reflect synchronized variationsin neuronal activity, to infer \"functional connectivity\". In studies of autismspectrum disorder (ASD), decreases in this measure of connectivity have beenfound by focusing on the response to task modulation, by using only the restperiods, or by analyzing purely resting_state data. This difference inconnectivity, however, could result from a number of differentdifferences in noise, task_related fluctuations, task performance, orspontaneous neuronal activity. In this study, we investigate the difference infunctional connectivity between adolescents with high_functioning ASD andtypically developing control subjects by examining the residual fluctuationsoccurring on top of the fMRI response to an overt verbal fluency task. We finddecreased correlations of these residuals (a decreased \"connectivity\") in ASDsubjects. Furthermore, we find that this decrease was not due to task_relatedeffects, block_to_block variations in task performance, or increased noise, andthe difference was greatest when primarily rest periods are considered. Thesefindings suggest that the estimate of disrupted functional connectivity in ASD islikely driven by differences in task_unrelated neuronal fluctuations.\n",
      "Title:  Development of large_scale functional brain networks in children.\n",
      "Abstract:  The ontogeny of large_scale functional organization of the human brain is notwell understood. Here we use network analysis of intrinsic functionalconnectivity to characterize the organization of brain networks in 23 children(ages 7_9 y) and 22 young_adults (ages 19_22 y). Comparison of networkproperties, including path_length, clustering_coefficient, hierarchy, andregional connectivity, revealed that although children and young_adults' brainshave similar \"small_world\" organization at the global level, they differsignificantly in hierarchical organization and interregional connectivity. Wefound that subcortical areas were more strongly connected with primary sensory,association, and paralimbic areas in children, whereas young_adults showedstronger cortico_cortical connectivity between paralimbic, limbic, andassociation areas. Further, combined analysis of functional connectivity withwiring distance measures derived from white_matter fiber tracking revealed thatthe development of large_scale brain networks is characterized by weakening ofshort_range functional connectivity and strengthening of long_range functionalconnectivity. Importantly, our findings show that the dynamic process ofover_connectivity followed by pruning, which rewires connectivity at the neuronallevel, also operates at the systems level, helping to reconfigure and rebalancesubcortical and paralimbic connectivity in the developing brain. Our studydemonstrates the usefulness of network analysis of brain connectivity toelucidate key principles underlying functional brain maturation, paving the wayfor novel studies of disrupted brain connectivity in neurodevelopmental disorderssuch as autism.\n",

      "Abstract:  OBJECTIVE: The Social Responsiveness Scale_Adult Version (SRS_A) measuresautistic traits that are continuously distributed in the general population.Based on increased recognition of the dimensional nature of autistic traits, theauthors examined the neural correlates of these traits in neurotypicalindividuals using the SRS_A and established a novel approach to assessing theneural basis of autistic characteristics, attempting to directly relate SRS_Ascores to patterns of functional connectivity observed in the pregenual anteriorcingulate cortex, a region commonly implicated in social cognition. METHOD:Resting state functional magnetic resonance imaging scans were collected for 25neurotypical adults. All participants provided SRS_A ratings completed by aninformant who had observed them in natural social settings. Whole brain_correctedconnectivity analyses were then conducted using SRS_A scores as a covariate ofinterest. RESULTS: Across participants, a significant negative relationshipbetween SRS_A scores and the functional connectivity of the pregenual anteriorcingulate cortex with the anterior portion of the mid_insula was found.Specifically, low levels of autistic traits were observed when a substantialportion of the anterior mid_insula showed positive connectivity with thepregenual anterior cingulate cortex. In contrast, elevated levels of autistictraits were associated with negative connectivity between these two regions.CONCLUSIONS: Resting state functional connectivity of the pregenual anteriorcingulate cortex_insula social network was related to autistic traits inneurotypical adults. Application of this approach in samples with autism spectrumdisorders is needed to confirm whether this circuit is dimensionally related tothe severity of autistic traits in clinical populations.\n",
      "Title:  Autism: a world changing too fast for a mis_wired brain?\n",
      "Abstract:  Disorders in verbal and emotional communication and imitation, social reciprocityand higher order cognition observed in individuals with autism spectrum disorders(ASD) are presented here as phenotypic expressions of temporo_spatial processingdisorders (TSPDs). TSPDs include various degrees of disability in (i) processingmulti_sensory dynamic stimuli online, (ii) associating them into meaningful andcoherent patterns and (iii) producing real_time sensory_motor adjustments andmotor outputs. In line with this theory, we found that slowing down the speed offacial and vocal events enhanced imitative, verbal and cognitive abilities insome ASD children, particularly those with low functioning autism. We then arguethat TSPDs may result from Multi_system Brain Disconnectivity_Dissynchrony (MBD),defined as an increase or decrease in functional connectivity and neuronalsynchronization within/between multiple neurofunctional territories and pathways.Recent functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and electrophysiologicalstudies supporting MBD are outlined. Finally, we review the suspected underlyingneurobiological mechanisms of MBD as evidenced in neuroimaging, genetic,environmental and epigenetic studies. Overall, our TSPD/MBD approach to ASD mayopen new promising avenues for a better understanding ofneuro_physio_psychopathology of ASD and clinical rehabilitation of peopleaffected by these syndromes.\n",
      "Title:  The neural substrates of cognitive control deficits in autism spectrum disorders.\n",
      "Abstract:  Executive function deficits are among the most frequently reported symptoms ofautism spectrum disorders (ASDs), however, there have been few functionalmagnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) studies that investigate the neural substratesof executive function deficits in ASDs, and only one in adolescents. The currentthe ability to maintain task context online toin 22adolescents aged 12_18 with autism spectrum disorders and 23 age, gender, and IQmatched typically developing subjects. During the cue phase of the task, wheresubjects must maintain information online to overcome a prepotent responsetendency, typically developing subjects recruited significantly more anteriorfrontal (BA 10), parietal (BA 7 and BA 40), and occipital regions (BA 18) forhigh control trials (25% of trials) versus low control trials (75% of trials).Both groups showed similar activation for low control cues, however the ASD groupexhibited significantly less activation for high control cues. Functionalconnectivity analysis using time series correlation, factor analysis, and betaseries correlation methods provided convergent evidence that the ASD groupexhibited lower levels of functional connectivity and less network integrationbetween frontal, parietal, and occipital regions. In the typically developinggroup, fronto_parietal connectivity was related to lower error rates on highcontrol trials. In the autism group, reduced fronto_parietal connectivity wasrelated to attention deficit hyperactivity disorder symptoms.\n",
      "Title:  Abnormalities of intrinsic functional connectivity in autism spectrum disorders.\n",
      "Abstract:  Autism spectrum disorders (ASD) impact social functioning and communication, andindividuals with these disorders often have restrictive and repetitive behaviors.Accumulating data indicate that ASD is associated with alterations of neuralcircuitry. Functional MRI (FMRI) studies have focused on connectivity in thecontext of psychological tasks. However, even in the absence of a task, the brainexhibits a high degree of functional connectivity, known as intrinsic or restingconnectivity. Notably, the default network, which includes the posteriorcingulate cortex, retro_splenial, lateral parietal cortex/angular gyrus, medialprefrontal cortex, superior frontal gyrus, temporal lobe, and parahippocampalgyrus, is strongly active when there is no task. Altered intrinsic connectivitywithin the default network may underlie offline processing that may actuate ASDimpairments. Using FMRI, we sought to evaluate intrinsic connectivity within thedefault network in ASD. Relative to controls, the ASD group showed weakerconnectivity between the posterior cingulate cortex and superior frontal gyrusand stronger connectivity between the posterior cingulate cortex and both theright temporal lobe and right parahippocampal gyrus. Moreover, poorer socialfunctioning in the ASD group was correlated with weaker connectivity between theposterior cingulate cortex and the superior frontal gyrus. In addition, moresevere restricted and repetitive behaviors in ASD were correlated with strongerconnectivity between the posterior cingulate cortex and right parahippocampalgyrus. These findings indicate that ASD subjects show altered intrinsicconnectivity within the default network, and connectivity between thesestructures is associated with specific ASD symptoms.\n",
      "Title:  Aberrant functional connectivity in autism: evidence from low_frequency BOLDsignal fluctuations.\n",
      "Abstract:  A number of recent studies have examined functional connectivity in individualswith Autism Spectrum Disorders (ASD), generally converging on the finding ofreduced interregional coordination, or underconnectivity. Underconnectivity hasbeen reported between many brain regions and across a range of cognitive tasks,and has been proposed to underlie behavioral and cognitive impairments associatedwith ASD. The current study employed functional connectivity MRI (fcMRI) toexamine interregional correlations of low_frequency BOLD signal fluctuations in10 high_functioning participants with ASD and 10 typically developing controlparticipants. Whole_brain connectivity with three seed regions of interest (leftmiddle frontal, left superior parietal, and left middle occipital cortex) wasevaluated using fMRI datasets acquired during performance of a source recognitiontask. While fcMRI patterns were found to be largely similar across the twogroups, including many common areas, effects for the ASD group were generallymore extensive. These findings, although inconsistent with generalizedunderconnectivity in ASD, are compatible with a model of aberrant connectivity inwhich the nature of connectivity disturbance (i.e., increased or reduced) mayvary by region. Taking into consideration methodological factors that mightinfluence measured fcMRI effects, we suggest that ASD is associated with aninefficiency in optimizing network connections to achieve task performance.\n",

      "Abstract:  Recent developments in functional imaging as well as the emergence of newanatomical imaging techniques suited for the study of white matter have shiftedinvestigational paradigms from a localized to a more holistic network approach.Aside from detecting local activity, functional MRI can be applied to the studyof connectivity. However, the concept of \"functional connectivity\" remains broad,and specific designs and analyses may affect the results. In addition,connectivity cannot be viewed in isolation. Rather, from a developmentalperspective, connectivity and local cortical architecture are intimately related.Therefore, combined approaches examining local organization and connectivity arethe most promising avenues for elucidating disturbances of neurofunctionalorganization in developmental disorders. Here this approach is illustrated viadata obtained from autism research that suggest impaired local corticalarchitecture and reduced long_range connectivity between cerebral regions.\n",

      "Abstract:  Unmasking the neural basis of neurodevelopmental disorders, such as autismspectrum disorders (ASD), requires studying functional connectivity duringchildhood when cognitive skills develop. A functional connectivity magneticresonance imaging (fcMRI) analysis was performed on data collected during Go/NoGotask performance from 24 children ages 8_12 years (12 with ASD; 12 controlsmatched on age and intellectual functioning). We investigated the connectivity ofthe left and right inferior frontal cortex (IFC; BA 47), key regions for responseinhibition, with other active regions in frontal, striatal, and parietal cortex.Groups did not differ on behavioral measures or functional connectivity of eitherIFC region. A trend for reduced connectivity in the right IFC for the ASD groupwas revealed when controlling for age. In the ASD group, there was a significantnegative correlation between age and 2 right IFC correlation pairs: rightIFC_bilateral presupplementary motor area (BA 6) and right IFC_right caudate.Compared with typical controls, children with ASD may not have gross differencesin IFC functional connectivity during response inhibition, which contrasts withan adult study of ASD that reported reduced functional connectivity. Thisdiscrepancy suggests an atypical developmental trajectory in ASD for right IFCconnectivity with other neural regions supporting response inhibition.\n",
      "Title:  EEG power and coherence in autistic spectrum disorder.\n",
      "Abstract:  OBJECTIVE: Autistic spectrum disorder (ASD) has been defined as aneurodevelopmental disorder with associated deficits in executive function,language, emotional, and social function. ASD has been associated withpathophysiology in cerebral organization. The current study investigatedquantitative EEG findings in twenty children diagnosed with autistic disorders ascompared to 20 controls matched for gender, age and IQ. METHODS: The EEG wasrecorded during an eyes_closed resting condition and topographical differences incerebral functioning were examined using estimates of absolute, relative, andtotal power, as well as intrahemispheric and interhemispheric coherences.RESULTS: There were group differences in power, intrahemispheric andinterhemispheric coherences. Findings included excessive theta, primarily inright posterior regions, in autistics. There was also a pattern of deficientdelta over the frontal cortex and excessive midline beta. More significantly,there was a pattern of underconnectivity in autistics compared to controls. Thisincluded decreased intrahemispheric delta and theta coherences across short tomedium and long inter_electrode distances. Interhemispherically, delta and thetacoherences were low across the frontal region. Delta, theta and alphahypocoherence was also evident over the temporal regions. Lastly, there were lowdelta, theta and beta coherence measurements across posterior regions.CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest dysfunctional integration of frontal andposterior brain regions in autistics along with a pattern of neuralunderconnectivity. This is consistent with other EEG, MRI and fMRI researchsuggesting that neural connectivity anomalies are a major deficit leading toautistic symptomatology. SIGNIFICANCE: This paper reports the largest integratedstudy of EEG power and coherence during a resting state in children sufferingautism spectrum disorder.\n",
      "Title:  Abnormal functional connectivity in autism spectrum disorders during faceprocessing.\n",
      "Abstract:  Abnormalities in the interactions between functionally linked brain regions havebeen suggested to be associated with the clinical impairments observed in autismspectrum disorders (ASD). We investigated functional connectivity within thelimbic system during face identification; a primary component of socialcognition, in 19 high_functioning adults with ASD and 21 age_and IQ_matchedcontrol adults. Activation during identification of previously viewed faces andhouses using a one_back paradigm was compared. The fusiform face area (FFA) wasindividually localized in each participant and used as the seed point forfunctional connectivity analyses. The degree of correlation between FFA and theextended neural circuitry involved in face identification was tested. A wholebrain analysis was also conducted in order to determine whether connectivity fromthe FFA to aberrant brain locations was present in the ASD group. Measures ofclinical severity (ADOS social score and ADI_R social score) were included asindependent variables into the functional connectivity analyses. SignificantFFA_amygdala and FFA_superior temporal sulcus functional connectivity was foundin both the ASD and control participants. However, the control group hadsignificantly increased connectivity to the left amygdala and the posteriorcingulate compared to ASD. Post hoc analyses additionally found increasedconnectivity to the thalamus in the controls. A significant relationship betweenabnormal functional connectivity and clinical severity in the ASD group wasobserved. Specifically, greater social impairment was associated with reducedFFA_amygdala connectivity and increased FFA_right inferior frontal connectivity.These results suggest that abnormal neural connections within the limbic systemmay contribute to the social impairments observed in ASD.\n",
      "Title:  The intrinsic functional organization of the brain is altered in autism.\n",
      "Abstract:  In higher functioning individuals with autism, a striking disparity existsbetween impaired social and emotional abilities and relatively preservedsustained attention and goal_directed cognitive abilities. As these twofunctional domains appear to map onto two distinct large_scale brain networks,the Task_Negative Network and the Task_Positive Network, respectively, weexamined their intrinsically defined functional organization in individuals withautism. Using resting functional connectivity MRI (fcMRI), we found that, inautism, there was altered functional organization of the network involved insocial and emotional processing, but no group difference in the functionalorganization of the network involved in sustained attention and goal_directedcognition. We suggest that these findings might serve to relate the seeminglydisparate strengths and weaknesses of the autistic behavioral, perceptual, andcognitive phenotype into a tractable neurofunctional framework. These resultsalso highlight the usefulness of resting fcMRI for studying the brain inneuropsychiatric and neurodevelopmental disorders.\n",

      "Abstract:  The intersection of Theory of Mind (ToM) processing and complex narrativecomprehension in high functioning autism was examined by comparing corticalactivation during the reading of passages that required inferences based oneither intentions, emotional states, or physical causality. Right hemisphereactivation was substantially greater for all sentences in the autism group thanin a matched control group suggesting decreased LH capacity in autism resultingin a spillover of processing to RH homologs. Moreover, the ToM network wasdisrupted. The autism group showed similar activation for all inference types inthe right temporo_parietal component of the ToM network whereas the controlparticipants selectively activated this network only when appropriate. The autismgroup had lower functional connectivity within the ToM network and also betweenthe ToM and a left hemisphere language network.

      "Title:  Development of distinct control networks through segregation and integration.\n",
      "Abstract:  Human attentional control is unrivaled. We recently proposed that adults dependon distinct frontoparietal and cinguloopercular networks for adaptive online taskcontrol versus more stable set control, respectively. During development, bothexperience_dependent evoked activity and spontaneous waves of synchronizedcortical activity are thought to support the formation and maintenance of neuralnetworks. Such mechanisms may encourage tighter \"integration\" of some regionsinto networks over time while \"segregating\" other sets of regions into separatenetworks. Here we use resting state functional connectivity MRI, which measurescorrelations in spontaneous blood oxygenation level_dependent signal fluctuationsbetween brain regions to compare previously identified control networks betweenchildren and adults. We find that development of the proposed adult controlnetworks involves both segregation (i.e., decreased short_range connections) andintegration (i.e., increased long_range connections) of the brain regions thatcomprise them. Delay/disruption in the developmental processes of segregation andintegration may play a role in disorders of control, such as autism, attentiondeficit hyperactivity disorder, and Tourette's syndrome.\n",

      "Abstract:  Brain activation and functional connectivity were investigated in highfunctioning autism using functional magnetic resonance imaging in an n_backworking memory task involving photographic face stimuli. The autism group showedreliably lower activation compared with controls in the inferior left prefrontalarea (involved in verbal processing and working memory maintenance) and the rightposterior temporal area (associated with theory of mind processing). Theparticipants with autism also showed activation in a somewhat different locationin the fusiform area than the control participants. These results suggest thatthe neural circuitry of the brain for face processing in autism may be analyzingthe features of the face more as objects and less in terms of their humansignificance. The functional connectivity results revealed that the abnormalfusiform activation was embedded in a larger context of smaller and lesssynchronized networks, particularly indicating lower functional connectivity withfrontal areas. In contrast to the underconnectivity with frontal areas, theautism group showed no underconnectivity among posterior cortical regions. Theseresults extend previous findings of abnormal face perception in autism bydemonstrating that the abnormalities are embedded in an abnormal cortical networkthat manages to perform the working memory task proficiently, using a visuallyoriented, asocial processing style that minimizes reliance on prefrontal areas.\n",

      "Abstract:  BACKGROUND: Theoretical conceptions of autism spectrum disorder (ASD) andexperimental studies of cerebral blood flow suggest abnormalities in connectionsamong distributed neural systems in ASD. METHODS: Functional connectivity wasassessed with electroencephalographic coherence between pairs of electrodes in ahigh_density electrode array in narrow frequency bands among 18 adults with ASDand 18 control adults in an eyes closed resting state. RESULTS: In the theta (3_6Hz) frequency range, locally elevated coherence was evident for the ASD group,especially within left hemisphere frontal and temporal regions. In the loweralpha range (8_10 Hz), globally reduced coherence was evident for the ASD groupwithin frontal regions and between frontal and all other scalp regions. The ASDgroup exhibited significantly greater relative power between 3 and 6 Hz and 13_17Hz and significantly less relative power between 9 and 10 Hz.

      "Title:  The study of autism as a distributed disorder.\n",
      "Abstract:  Past autism research has often been dedicated to tracing the causes of thedisorder to a localized neurological abnormality, a single functional network, ora single cognitive_behavioral domain. In this review, I argue that autism is a\"distributed disorder\" on various levels of study (genetic, neuroanatomical,neurofunctional, behavioral). \"Localizing\" models are therefore not promising.The large array of potential genetic risk factors suggests that multiple (or all)emerging functional brain networks are affected during early development. This issupported by widespread growth abnormalities throughout the brain. Interactionsduring development between affected functional networks and atypical experientialeffects (associated with atypical behavior) in children with autism furthercomplicate the neurological bases of the disorder, resulting in an \"exponentiallydistributed\" profile. Promising approaches to a better characterization of neuralendophenotypes in autism are provided by techniques investigating white matterand connectivity, such as MR spectroscopy, diffusion_tensor imaging (DTI), andfunctional connectivity MRI. According to a recent hypothesis, the autistic brainis generally characterized by \"underconnectivity.\" However, not all findings areconsistent with this view. The concepts and methodology of functionalconnectivity need to be refined and results need to be corroborated by anatomicalstudies (such as DTI tractography) before definitive conclusions can be drawn.\n",
      "Title:  A developmental study of the structural integrity of white matter in autism.\n",
      "Abstract:  Diffusion tensor imaging was used to examine developmental changes in theorganization of white matter in a large sample of male participants with autismand controls between the ages of 10 and 35 years. Participants with autism hadlower fractional anisotropy in areas within and near the corpus callosum and inthe right retrolenticular portion of the internal capsule. Only one area, in theposterior limb of the right internal capsule, showed an interaction between ageand group. The findings suggest that reductions in the structural integrity ofwhite matter in autism persist into adulthood. These reductions may underlie thebehavioral pattern observed in autism, as well as findings of reduced functionalconnectivity in functional magnetic resonance imaging signal between activatingcortical areas.\n",

This activationatypicality has been observed mostly during the performance of cognitive tasks.This study compares the resting_state network of 57 participants with autism and57 control participants matched for age and intelligence quotient. The resultsindicate that both groups have a resting_state network that is very similar bothin volume and in organization, but in autism this network is much more looselyconnected.

      "Abstract:  BACKGROUND: Autism is a neurodevelopmental disorder affecting sociocommunicativebehavior, but also sensorimotor skill learning, oculomotor control, and executivefunctioning. Some of these impairments may be related to abnormalities of thecaudate nuclei, which have been reported for autism. METHODS: Our sample wascomprised of 8 high_functioning males with autism and 8 handedness, sex, andage_matched controls. Subjects underwent functional MRI scanning duringperformance on simple visuomotor coordination tasks. Functional connectivity MRI(fcMRI) effects were identified as interregional blood oxygenation leveldependent (BOLD) signal cross_correlation, using the caudate nuclei as seedvolumes. RESULTS: In the control group, fcMRI effects were found in circuits withknown participation of the caudate nuclei (associative, orbitofrontal,oculomotor, motor circuits). Although in the autism group fcMRI effects withinthese circuits were less pronounced or absent, autistic subjects showed diffuselyincreased connectivity mostly in pericentral regions, but also in brain areasoutside expected anatomical circuits (such as visual cortex). CONCLUSION: Theseatypical connectivity patterns may be linked to developmental brain growthdisturbances recently reported in autism and suggest inefficiently organizedfunctional connectivity between caudate nuclei and cerebral cortex, potentiallyaccounting for stereotypic behaviors and executive impairments.\n",

      "Abstract:  Comprehending high_imagery sentences like The number eight when rotated 90degrees looks like a pair of eyeglasses involves the participation andintegration of several cortical regions. The linguistic content must be processedto determine what is to be mentally imaged, and then the mental image must beevaluated and related to the sentence. A theory of cortical underconnectivity inautism predicts that the interregional collaboration required between linguisticand imaginal processing in this task would be underserved in autism. Thisfunctional MRI study examined brain activation in 12 participants with autism andand IQ_matched control participants while they processed sentences withor low_imagery content. The analysis of functional connectivityamong cortical regions showed that the language and spatial centres in theparticipants with autism were not as well synchronized as in controls. Inaddition to the functional connectivity differences, there was also a groupdifference in activation. In the processing of low_imagery sentences (e.g.Addition, subtraction and multiplication are all math skills), the use of imageryis not essential to comprehension. Nevertheless, the autism group activatedparietal and occipital brain regions associated with imagery for comprehendingboth the low and high_imagery sentences, suggesting that they were using mentalimagery in both conditions. In contrast, the control group showed imagery_relatedactivation primarily in the high_imagery condition. The findings provide furtherevidence of underintegration of language and imagery in autism (and hence expandthe understanding of underconnectivity) but also show that people with autism aremore reliant on visualization to support language comprehension.\n",

      "Abstract:  Based on evidence for thalamic abnormalities in autism, impairments ofthalamocortical pathways have been suspected. We examined the functionalconnectivity between thalamus and cerebral cortex in terms of blood oxygen leveldependent (BOLD) signal cross_correlation in 8 male participants withhigh_functioning autism and matched normal controls, using functional MRI duringsimple visuomotor coordination. Both groups exhibited widespread connectivity,consistent with known extensive thalamocortical connectivity. In a direct groupcomparison, overall more extensive connectivity was observed in the autism group,especially in the left insula and in right postcentral and middle frontalregions. Our findings are inconsistent with the hypothesis of generalunderconnectivity in autism and instead suggest that subcortico_corticalconnectivity may be hyperfunctional, potentially compensating for reducedcortico_cortical connectivity.\n",

      "Abstract:  The brain activation of a group of high_functioning autistic participants wasmeasured using functional magnetic resonance imaging during the performance of aTower of London task, in comparison with a control group matched with respect tointelligent quotient, age, and gender. The 2 groups generally activated the samecortical areas to similar degrees. However, there were 3 indications ofunderconnectivity in the group with autism. First, the degree of synchronization(i.e., the functional connectivity or the correlation of the time series of theactivation) between the frontal and parietal areas of activation was lower forthe autistic than the control participants. Second, relevant parts of the corpuscallosum, through which many of the bilaterally activated cortical areascommunicate, were smaller in cross_sectional area in the autistic participants.Third, within the autism group but not within the control group, the size of thegenu of the corpus callosum was correlated with frontal_parietal functionalconnectivity. These findings suggest that the neural basis of altered cognitionin autism entails a lower degree of integration of information across certaincortical areas resulting from reduced intracortical connectivity. The results addsupport to a new theory of cortical underconnectivity in autism, which posits adeficit in integration of information at the neural and cognitive levels.\n",

There were less salientabnormalities in functional connectivity of anterior cingulate, inferioroccipital, and inferior frontal cortex, but there was no significant differencebetween groups in whole brain functional connectivity. CONCLUSIONS: We concludethere is evidence that functional connectivity of medial temporal lobe structuresspecifically is abnormal in people with Asperger's syndrome during fearful faceprocessing.\n",

      "Abstract:  Some recent evidence has suggested abnormalities of the dorsal stream andpossibly the mirror neuron system in autism, which may be responsible forimpairments of joint attention, imitation, and secondarily for language delays.The current study investigates functional connectivity along the dorsal stream inautism, examining interregional blood oxygenation level dependent (BOLD) signalcross_correlation during visuomotor coordination. Eight high_functioning autisticmen and eight handedness and age_matched controls were included. Visuallyprompted button presses were performed with the preferred hand. For each subject,functional connectivity was computed in terms of BOLD signal correlation with themean time series in bilateral visual area 17. Our hypothesis of reduced dorsalstream connectivity in autism was only in part confirmed. Functional connectivitywith superior parietal areas was not significantly reduced. However, the autismgroup showed significantly reduced connectivity with bilateral inferior frontalarea 44, which is compatible with the hypothesis of mirror neuron defects inautism. More generally, our findings suggest that dorsal stream connectivity inautism may not be fully functional.\n",

      "Abstract:  An fMRI study was used to measure the brain activation of a group of adults withhigh_functioning autism compared to a Full Scale and Verbal IQ and age_matchedcontrol group during an n_back working memory task with letters. The behavioralresults showed comparable performance, but the fMRI results suggested that thenormal controls might use verbal codes to perform the task, while the adults withautism might use visual codes. The control group demonstrated more activation inthe left than the right parietal regions, whereas the autism group showed moreright lateralized activation in the prefrontal and parietal regions. The autismgroup also had more activation than the control group in the posterior regionsincluding inferior temporal and occipital regions. The analysis of functionalconnectivity yielded similar patterns for the two groups with differenthemispheric correlations. The temporal profile of the activity in the prefrontalregions was more correlated with the left parietal regions for the control group,whereas it was more correlated with the right parietal regions for the autismgroup.\n",
      "Title:  Cortical activation and synchronization during sentence comprehension inhigh_functioning autism: evidence of underconnectivity.\n",
      "Abstract:  The brain activation of a group of high_functioning autistic participants wasmeasured using functional MRI during sentence comprehension and the resultscompared with those of a Verbal IQ_matched control group. The groups differed inthe distribution of activation in two of the key language areas. The autism groupproduced reliably more activation than the control group in Wernicke's (leftlaterosuperior temporal) area and reliably less activation than the control groupin Broca's (left inferior frontal gyrus) area. Furthermore, the functionalconnectivity, i.e. the degree of synchronization or correlation of the timeseries of the activation, between the various participating cortical areas wasconsistently lower for the autistic than the control participants. These findingssuggest that the neural basis of disordered language in autism entails a lowerdegree of information integration and synchronization across the large_scalecortical network for language processing. The article presents a theoreticalaccount of the findings, related to neurobiological foundations ofunderconnectivity in autism.\n",
      "Title:  Autism, Asperger syndrome and brain mechanisms for the attribution of mentalstates to animated shapes.\n",
      "Abstract:  Ten able adults with autism or Asperger syndrome and 10 normal volunteers werePET scanned while watching animated sequences. The animations depicted twotriangles moving about on a screen in three different conditions: movingrandomly, moving in a goal_directed fashion (chasing, fighting), and movinginteractively with implied intentions (coaxing, tricking). The last conditionfrequently elicited descriptions in terms of mental states that viewersattributed to the triangles (mentalizing). The autism group gave fewer and lessaccurate descriptions of these latter animations, but equally accuratedescriptions of the other animations compared with controls. While viewinganimations that elicited mentalizing, in contrast to randomly moving shapes, thenormal group showed increased activation in a previously identified mentalizingnetwork (medial prefrontal cortex, superior temporal sulcus at thetemporo_parietal junction and temporal poles). The autism group showed lessactivation than the normal group in all these regions. However, one additionalregion, extrastriate cortex, which was highly active when watching animationsthat elicited mentalizing, showed the same amount of increased activation in bothgroups. In the autism group this extrastriate region showed reduced functionalconnectivity with the superior temporal sulcus at the temporo_parietal junction,an area associated with the processing of biological motion as well as withmentalizing. This finding suggests a physiological cause for the mentalizingdysfunction in autism: a bottleneck in the interaction between higher order andlower order perceptual processes.\n"

      "abstract={The identification of connexel-wise associations, which involves examining functional connectivities between pairwise voxels across the whole brain, is both statistically and computationally challenging. Although such a connexel-wise methodology has recently been adopted by brain-wide association studies (BWAS) to identify connectivity changes in several mental disorders, such as schizophrenia, autism and depression, the multiple correction and power analysis methods designed specifically for connexel-wise analysis are still lacking. Therefore, we herein report the development of a rigorous statistical framework for connexel-wise significance testing based on the Gaussian random field theory. It includes controlling the family-wise error rate (FWER) of multiple hypothesis testings using topological inference methods, and calculating power and sample size for a connexel-wise study. Our theoretical framework can control the false-positive rate accurately, as validated empirically using two resting-state fMRI datasets. Compared with Bonferroni correction and false discovery rate (FDR), it can reduce false-positive rate and increase statistical power by appropriately utilizing the spatial information of fMRI data. Importantly, our method bypasses the need of non-parametric permutation to correct for multiple comparison, thus, it can efficiently tackle large datasets with high resolution fMRI images. The utility of our method is shown in a case-control study. Our approach can identify altered functional connectivities in a major depression disorder dataset, whereas existing methods fail.

      "abstract={Identification of comparable biomarkers in humans and validated animal models will facilitate pre-clinical to clinical therapeutic pipelines to treat neurodevelopmental disorders. Fragile X Syndrome (FXS) is a leading known genetic cause of intellectual disability with symptoms that include increased anxiety, social and sensory processing deficits. Recent EEG studies in humans with FXS have identified neural oscillation deficits that include enhanced resting state gamma power and reduced inter-trial coherence of sound evoked gamma oscillations. To determine if analogous phenotypes are present in an animal model of FXS, we recorded EEGs in awake, freely moving Fmr1 knock out (KO) mice using similar stimuli as in the human studies. We report remarkably similar neural oscillation phenotypes in the Fmr1 KO mouse including enhanced resting state gamma power and reduced evoked gamma synchronization. The gamma band inter-trial coherence of neural response was reduced in both auditory and frontal cortex of Fmr1 KO mice stimulated with a sound whose envelope was modulated from 1 to 100 Hz, similar to that seen in humans with FXS. These deficits suggest a form of enhanced ‘resting state noise’ that interferes with the ability of the circuit to mount a synchronized response to sensory input, predicting specific sensory and cognitive deficits in FXS. The abnormal gamma oscillations are consistent with parvalbumin neuron and perineuronal net deficits seen in the Fmr1 KO mouse auditory cortex indicating that the EEG biomarkers are not only clinically relevant, but could also be used to probe cellular and circuit mechanisms of sensory hypersensitivity in FXS. © 2018 Elsevier Inc.},\n",

Here, we report that Chd8 heterozygous mice display increased brain size, motor delay, hypertelorism, pronounced hypoactivity, and anomalous responses to social stimuli. Whereas gene expression in the neocortex is only mildly affected at midgestation, over 600 genes are differentially expressed in the early postnatal neocortex. Genes involved in cell adhesion and axon guidance are particularly prominent amongst the downregulated transcripts. Resting-state functional MRI identified increased synchronized activity in cortico-hippocampal and auditory-parietal networks in Chd8 heterozygous mutant mice, implicating altered connectivity as a potential mechanism underlying the behavioral phenotypes.

      "abstract={To refine our understanding of autism spectrum disorders (ASD), studies of the brain in dynamic, multimodal and ecological experimental settings are required. One way to achieve this is to compare the neural responses of ASD and typically developing (TD) individuals when viewing a naturalistic movie, but the temporal complexity of the stimulus hampers this task, and the presence of intrinsic functional connectivity (FC) may overshadow movie-driven fluctuations. Here, we detected inter-subject functional correlation (ISFC) transients to disentangle movie-induced functional changes from underlying resting-state activity while probing FC dynamically. When considering the number of significant ISFC excursions triggered by the movie across the brain, connections between remote functional modules were more heterogeneously engaged in the ASD population. Dynamically tracking the temporal profiles of those ISFC changes and tying them to specific movie subparts, this idiosyncrasy in ASD responses was then shown to involve functional integration and segregation mechanisms such as response inhibition, background suppression, or multisensory integration, while low-level visual processing was spared. Through the application of a new framework for the study of dynamic experimental paradigms, our results reveal a temporally localized idiosyncrasy in ASD responses, specific to short-lived episodes of long-range functional interplays. © 2018 The Authors Human Brain Mapping Published by Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},\n",

      "abstract={Identifying regional effects of interest in MRI datasets usually entails testing a priori hypotheses across many thousands of brain voxels, requiring control for false positive findings in these multiple hypotheses testing. Recent studies have suggested that parametric statistical methods may have incorrectly modeled functional MRI data, thereby leading to higher false positive rates than their nominal rates. Nonparametric methods for statistical inference when conducting multiple statistical tests, in contrast, are thought to produce false positives at the nominal rate, which has thus led to the suggestion that previously reported studies should reanalyze their fMRI data using nonparametric tools. To understand better why parametric methods may yield excessive false positives, we assessed their performance when applied both to simulated datasets of 1D, 2D, and 3D Gaussian Random Fields (GRFs) and to 710 real-world, resting-state fMRI datasets. We showed that both the simulated 2D and 3D GRFs and the real-world data contain a small percentage (<6%) of very large clusters (on average 60 times larger than the average cluster size), which were not present in 1D GRFs. These unexpectedly large clusters were deemed statistically significant using parametric methods, leading to empirical familywise error rates (FWERs) as high as 65%: the high empirical FWERs were not a consequence of parametric methods failing to model spatial smoothness accurately, but rather of these very large clusters that are inherently present in smooth, high-dimensional random fields. In fact, when discounting these very large clusters, the empirical FWER for parametric methods was 3.24%. Furthermore, even an empirical FWER of 65% would yield on average less than one of those very large clusters in each brain-wide analysis. Nonparametric methods, in contrast, estimated distributions from those large clusters, and therefore, by construct rejected the large clusters as false positives at the nominal FWERs. Those rejected clusters were outlying values in the distribution of cluster size but cannot be distinguished from true positive findings without further analyses, including assessing whether fMRI signal in those regions correlates with other clinical, behavioral, or cognitive measures. Rejecting the large clusters, however, significantly reduced the statistical power of nonparametric methods in detecting true findings compared with parametric methods, which would have detected most true findings that are essential for making valid biological inferences in MRI data. Parametric analyses, in contrast, detected most true findings while generating relatively few false positives: on average, less than one of those very large clusters would be deemed a true finding in each brain-wide analysis. We therefore recommend the continued use of parametric methods that model nonstationary smoothness for cluster-level, familywise control of false positives, particularly when using a Cluster Defining Threshold of 2.5 or higher, and subsequently assessing rigorously the biological plausibility of the findings, even for large clusters. Finally, because nonparametric methods yielded a large reduction in statistical power to detect true positive findings, we conclude that the modest reduction in false positive findings that nonparametric analyses afford does not warrant a re-analysis of previously published fMRI studies using nonparametric techniques. © 2018 Elsevier Inc.},\n",

      "abstract={Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a neurodevelopmental disorder in which the severity of symptoms varies over subjects. The iCAPs model (innovation-driven co-activation patterns) is a recently developed spatio-temporal model to describe fMRI data. In this study, the iCAPs model was employed to find functional imaging biomarkers for ASD in resting-state fMRI data. MRI data from 125 ASD patients and 243 healthy controls was selected from the online ABIDE data repository. Following standard fMRI preprocessing steps, the iCAP patterns were fitted to the data to obtain network time series. Furthermore, specific combinations of iCAPs were mapped to behavioral domain time series. To quantify to which extent the time series contribute to the fMRI dynamics, their (temporal) standard deviation was calculated and compared between patients and controls. Abnormalities were found in networks involving subcortical and limbic areas and default mode network regions. When mapping the network dynamics to behavioral domain time series, abnormalities were found in emotional and visual behavioral subdomains, and within the ASD spectrum were more pronounced in subjects with autism compared to Asperger's syndrome. Also a trend towards impairment in networks facilitating social cognition was found. The functional imaging abnormalities are consistent with the behavioral impairments typical for ASD. © 2018},\n",

Emphasis was given to potential gender and developmental effects as well as identification of specific networks that may contribute to the global results. Methods: We leveraged an open data resource (N = 1587) of resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging data in the Autism Brain Imaging Data Exchange (ABIDE) initiative, combining data from more than 2100 unique cross-sectional datasets in ABIDE I and ABIDE II collected at different sites. Modularity and global efficiency were utilized to assess functional segregation and integration, respectively. A meta-analytic approach for handling site differences was used. The effects of age, gender, and diagnostic category on segregation and integration were assessed using linear regression. Results: Modularity decreased nonlinearly in the ASD group with age, as evidenced by an increase and then decrease over development. Global efficiency had an opposite relationship with age by first decreasing and then increasing in the ASD group. Both modularity and global efficiency remained largely stable in the typically developing control group during development, representing a significantly different effect than seen in the ASD group. Age effects on modularity were localized to the somatosensory network. Finally, a marginally significant interaction between age, gender, and diagnostic category was found for modularity. Conclusions: Our results support prior work that suggested a quadratic effect of age on brain development in ASD, while providing new insights about the specific characteristics of developmental and gender effects on intrinsic connectivity in ASD. © 2017 Society of Biological Psychiatry},\n",

      "abstract={Background: There is evidence suggesting neuropsychiatric disorders share genomic, cognitive and clinical features. Here, we ask if autism-spectrum disorders (ASD), attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and schizophrenia share neuroanatomical variations. Methods: First, we used measures of cortical anatomy to estimate spatial overlap of neuroanatomical variation using univariate methods. Next, we developed a novel methodology to determine whether cortical deficits specifically target or are “enriched” within functional resting-state networks. Results: We found cortical anomalies were preferentially enriched across functional networks rather than clustering spatially. Specifically, cortical thickness showed significant enrichment between patients with ASD and those with ADHD in the default mode network, between patients with ASD and those with schizophrenia in the frontoparietal and limbic networks, and between patients with ADHD and those with schizophrenia in the ventral attention network. Networks enriched in cortical thickness anomalies were also strongly represented in functional MRI results (Neurosynth; r = 0.64, p = 0.032). Limitations: We did not account for variable symptom dimensions and severity in patient populations, and our cross-sectional design prevented longitudinal analyses of developmental trajectories. Conclusion: These findings suggest that common deficits across neuropsychiatric disorders cannot simply be characterized as arising out of local changes in cortical grey matter, but rather as entities of both local and systemic alterations targeting brain networks. © 2018 Joule Inc. or its licensors.},\n",

      "abstract={Initial studies using resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging on the trajectories of the brain network from childhood to adulthood found evidence of functional integration and segregation over time. The comprehension of how healthy individuals’ functional integration and segregation occur is crucial to enhance our understanding of possible deviations that may lead to brain disorders. Recent approaches have focused on the framework wherein the functional brain network is organized into spatially distributed modules that have been associated with specific cognitive functions. Here, we tested the hypothesis that the clustering structure of brain networks evolves during development. To address this hypothesis, we defined a measure of how well a brain region is clustered (network fitness index), and developed a method to evaluate its association with age. Then, we applied this method to a functional magnetic resonance imaging data set composed of 397 males under 31 years of age collected as part of the Autism Brain Imaging Data Exchange Consortium. As results, we identified two brain regions for which the clustering change over time, namely, the left middle temporal gyrus and the left putamen. Since the network fitness index is associated with both integration and segregation, our finding suggests that the identified brain region plays a role in the development of brain systems. © 2018 Guzman et al.

Resting-state fMRI scans from thirty subjects with ASD and thirty-two age-matched, typically developing control subjects were analysed. Seed-to-voxel and ROI-to-ROI functional connectivity analyses were used to examine resting-state connectivity in a number of cortical and subcortical neural networks. Bivariate correlation analysis was performed to examine the relationship between repetitive behaviour scores from the Repetitive Behaviour Scale – Revised and intrinsic functional connectivity in ASD subjects. Compared to control subjects, ASD subjects displayed marked over-connectivity of the thalamus with several cortical sensory processing areas, as well as over-connectivity of the basal ganglia with somatosensory and motor cortices. Within the ASD group, significant correlations were found between functional connectivity patterns and total RBS-R scores as well as one principal component analysis-derived score from the RBS-R. These results suggest that thalamocortical resting-state connectivity is altered in individuals with ASD, and that resting-state functional connectivity is associated with ASD symptomatology. © 2018},\n",

These contradictory findings leave open the question of whether and to what extent functional connectivity of the insula is altered and how functional connectivity of the insula is associated with the severity of ASD. A newly emerging insular atlas that comprises multiple functionally differentiated subregions provides a new framework to interpret the functional significance of insular findings and uncover the mechanisms underlying the severity of ASD. Using the new insular atlas, the present study aimed to investigate the distinct functional connectivity of the insular subregions and their associations with ASD severity in a cohort of 49 children with ASD and 33 typically developing (TD) subjects. We found that compared with TD group, the ASD group showed different connectivity patterns in the left ventral agranular insula, right ventral dysgranular and granular insula, and dorsal dysgranular insula, characterized by significant hyper-connectivity and/or hypo-connectivity with special brain regions. Furthermore, both the hypo-connectivity and hyper-connectivity patterns of the insular subregions were significantly associated with the severity of ASD symptoms. Our research demonstrated distinct functional connectivity patterns of the insular subregions and emphasized the importance of the subdivisions within the insula to the potential impact of functional difference in children with ASD. Moreover, these results might help us to better understand the mechanisms underlying the symptoms in children with ASD and might elucidate potential biomarkers for clinical applications. © 2018 Xu, Wang, Zhang, Xu, Li, Zhou, Zhou, Gan and Hu.},\n",

However, the genetic and neurobiological underpinnings of these findings remain unclear. Homozygous mutations in contactin associated protein-like 2 (CNTNAP2), a neurexin-related cell-adhesion protein, are strongly linked to autism and epilepsy. Here we used rsfMRI to show that homozygous mice lacking Cntnap2 exhibit reduced long-range and local functional connectivity in prefrontal and midline brain “connectivity hubs.” Long-range rsfMRI connectivity impairments affected heteromodal cortical regions and were prominent between fronto-posterior components of the mouse default-mode network, an effect that was associated with reduced social investigation, a core “autism trait” in mice. Notably, viral tracing revealed reduced frequency of prefrontal-projecting neural clusters in the cingulate cortex of Cntnap2−/− mutants, suggesting a possible contribution of defective mesoscale axonal wiring to the observed functional impairments. Macroscale cortico-cortical white-matter organization appeared to be otherwise preserved in these animals. These findings reveal a key contribution of ASD-associated gene CNTNAP2 in modulating macroscale functional connectivity, and suggest that homozygous loss-of-function mutations in this gene may predispose to neurodevelopmental disorders and autism through a selective dysregulation of connectivity in integrative prefrontal areas. © 2018 Oxford University Press.

      "abstract={Prevalence of certain forms of psychopathology, such as autism and depression, differs between genders and understanding gender differences of the neurotypical brain may provide insights into risk and protective factors. In recent research, resting state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rfMRI) is widely used to map the inherent functional networks of the brain. Although previous studies have reported gender differences in rfMRI, the robustness of gender differences is not well characterized. In this study, we use a large data set to test whether rfMRI functional connectivity (FC) can be used to predict gender and identify FC features that are most predictive of gender. We utilized rfMRI data from 820 healthy controls from the Human Connectome Project. By applying a predefined functional template and partial least squares regression modeling, we achieved a gender prediction accuracy of 87% when multi-run rfMRI was used. Permutation tests confirmed that gender prediction was reliable (p >.001). Effects of motion, age, handedness, blood pressure, weight, and brain volume on gender prediction are discussed. Further, we found that FC features within the default mode (DMN), fronto-parietal and sensorimotor networks contributed most to gender prediction. In the DMN, right fusiform gyrus and right ventromedial prefrontal cortex were important contributors. The above regions have been previously implicated in aspects of social functioning and this suggests potential gender differences in social cognition mediated by the DMN. Our findings demonstrate that gender can be reliably predicted using rfMRI data and highlight the importance of controlling for gender in brain imaging studies. © 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},\n",

      "abstract={Tourette syndrome (TS) is a childhood-onset neurological disorder. To date, accurate TS diagnosis remains challenging due to its varied clinical expressions and dependency on qualitative description of symptoms. Therefore, identifying accurate and objective neuroimaging biomarkers may help improve early TS diagnosis. As resting-state functional MRI (rs-fMRI) has been demonstrated as a promising neuroimaging tool for TS diagnosis, previous rs-fMRI studies on TS revealed functional connectivity (FC) changes in a few local brain networks or circuits. However, no study explored the disrupted topological organization of whole-brain FC networks in TS children. Meanwhile, very few studies have examined brain functional networks using machine-learning methods for diagnostics. In this study, we construct individual whole-brain, ROI-level FC networks for 29 drug-naive TS children and 37 healthy children. Then, we use graph theory analysis to investigate the topological disruptions between groups. The identified disrupted regions in FC networks not only involved the sensorimotor association regions but also the visual, default-mode and language areas, all highly related to TS. Furthermore, we propose a novel classification framework based on similarity network fusion (SNF) algorithm, to both diagnose an individual subject and explore the discriminative power of FC network topological properties in distinguishing between TS children and controls. We achieved a high accuracy of 88.79%, and the involved discriminative regions for classification were also highly related to TS. Together, both the disrupted topological properties between groups and the discriminative topological features for classification may be considered as comprehensive and helpful neuroimaging biomarkers for assisting the clinical TS diagnosis. © 2017, Springer Science+Business Media New York.},\n",

      "abstract={Key points: Shank3 increases the HCN channel surface expression in heterologous expression systems. Shank3Δ13–16 deficiency causes significant reduction in HCN2 expression and Ih current amplitude in thalamocortical (TC) neurons. Shank3Δ13–16- but not Shank3Δ4–9-deficient TC neurons share changes in basic electrical properties which are comparable to those of HCN2−/− TC neurons. HCN channelopathy may critically mediate events downstream from Shank3 deficiency. Abstract: SHANK3 is a scaffolding protein that is highly enriched in excitatory synapses. Mutations in the SHANK3 gene have been linked to neuropsychiatric disorders especially the autism spectrum disorders. SHANK3 deficiency is known to cause impairments in synaptic transmission, but its effects on basic neuronal electrical properties that are more localized to the soma and proximal dendrites remain unclear. Here we confirmed that in heterologous expression systems two different mouse Shank3 isoforms, Shank3A and Shank3C, significantly increase the surface expression of the mouse hyperpolarization-activated, cyclic-nucleotide-gated (HCN) channel. In Shank3Δ13–16 knockout mice, which lack exons 13–16 in the Shank3 gene (both Shank3A and Shank3C are removed) and display a severe behavioural phenotype, the expression of HCN2 is reduced to an undetectable level. The thalamocortical (TC) neurons from the ventrobasal (VB) complex of Shank3Δ13–16 mice demonstrate reduced Ih current amplitude and correspondingly increased input resistance, negatively shifted resting membrane potential, and abnormal spike firing in both tonic and burst modes. Impressively, these changes closely resemble those of HCN2−/− TC neurons but not of the TC neurons from Shank3Δ4–9 mice, which lack exons 4–9 in the Shank3 gene (Shank3C still exists) and demonstrate moderate behavioural phenotypes. Additionally, Shank3 deficiency increases the ratio of excitatory/inhibitory balance in VB neurons but has a limited impact on the electrical properties of connected thalamic reticular (RTN) neurons. These results provide new understanding about the role of HCN channelopathy in mediating detrimental effects downstream from Shank3 deficiency. © 2018 Virginia Commonwealth University.

Multiple sources of evidence have suggested a neurophenotypic convergence of ASD-related characteristics and typical sex differences. Two existing, albeit competing, models provide predictions on such neurophenotypic convergence. These two models are testable with neuroimaging. Specifically, the Extreme Male Brain (EMB) model predicts that ASD is associated with enhanced brain maleness in both males and females with ASD (i.e., a shift-towards-maleness). In contrast, the Gender Incoherence (GI) model predicts a shift-towards-maleness in females, yet a shift-towards-femaleness in males with ASD. Methods: To clarify whether either model applies to the intrinsic functional properties of the brain in males with ASD, we measured the statistical overlap between typical sex differences and ASD-related atypicalities in resting-state fMRI (R-fMRI) datasets largely available in males. Main analyses focused on two large-scale R-fMRI samples: 357 neurotypical (NT) males and 471 NT females from the 1000 Functional Connectome Project and 360 males with ASD and 403 NT males from the Autism Brain Imaging Data Exchange. Results: Across all R-fMRI metrics, results revealed coexisting, but network-specific, shift-towards-maleness and shift-towards-femaleness in males with ASD. A shift-towards-maleness mostly involved the default network, while a shift-towards-femaleness mostly occurred in the somatomotor network. Explorations of the associated cognitive processes using available cognitive ontology maps indicated that higher-order social cognitive functions corresponded to the shift-towards-maleness, while lower-order sensory motor processes corresponded to the shift-towards-femaleness. Conclusions: The present findings suggest that atypical intrinsic brain properties in males with ASD partly reflect mechanisms involved in sexual differentiation. A model based on network-dependent atypical sex mosaicism can synthesize prior competing theories on factors involved in sex differentiation in ASD. © 2018 The Author(s).},\n",

      "abstract={Autism spectrum disorder is a neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by core deficits in social functioning. Core autistics traits refer to poor social and imagination skills, poor attention-switching/strong focus of attention, exceptional attention to detail, as expressed by the autism-spectrum quotient. Over the years, the importance of the cerebellum in the aetiology of autism spectrum disorder has been acknowledged. Neuroimaging studies have provided a strong support to this view, showing both structural and functional connectivity alterations to affect the cerebellum in autism spectrum disorder. According to the underconnectivity theory, disrupted connectivity within cerebello-cerebral networks has been specifically implicated in the aetiology of autism spectrum disorder. However, inconsistent results have been generated across studies. In this study, an integrated approach has been used in a selected population of adults with autism spectrum disorder to analyse both cerebellar morphometry and functional connectivity. In individuals with autism spectrum disorder, a decreased cerebellar grey matter volume affected the right Crus II, a region showing extensive connections with cerebral areas related to social functions. This grey matter reduction correlates with the degree of autistic traits as measured by autism-spectrum quotient. Interestingly, altered functional connectivity was found between the reduced cerebellar Crus II and contralateral cerebral regions, such as frontal and temporal areas. Overall, the present data suggest that adults with autism spectrum disorder present with specific cerebellar structural alterations that may affect functional connectivity within cerebello-cerebral modules relevant to social processing and account for core autistics traits. © 2017 Federation of European Neuroscience Societies and John Wiley & Sons Ltd},\n",

      "abstract={Socio-behavioral impairments are important characteristics of autism spectrum disorders (ASD) and MRI-based studies are pursued to identify a neurobiological basis behind these conditions. This paper presents an MRI-based study undertaken to (i) identify the differences in brain activities due to ASD, (ii) verify whether such differences exist within the ‘social brain’ circuit which is hypothesized to be responsible for social functions, and (iii) uncover potential compensatory mechanisms within the identified differences in brain activities. In this study, a whole-brain voxel-wise analysis is performed using resting-state fMRI data from 598 adolescent males, that is openly available from the ABIDE consortium. A new method is developed, which can (i) extract the discriminative brain activities, that provide high separability between the blood oxygenation time-series signals from ASD and neurotypical populations, (ii) select the activities that are relevant to ASD by evaluating the correlation between the separability and traditional severity scores, and (iii) map the spatial pattern of regions responsible for generating the discriminative activities. The results show that the most discriminative brain activities occur within a subset of the social brain that is involved with affective aspects of social processing, thereby supporting the idea of the social brain and also its fractionalization in ASD. Further, it has also been found that the diminished activities in the posterior cingulate area are potentially compensated by enhanced activities in the ventromedial prefrontal and anterior temporal areas within the social brain. Hemispherical lateralization is also observed on such compensatory activities. © 2017 Federation of European Neuroscience Societies and John Wiley & Sons Ltd},\n",

      "abstract={Ultra-high dimensional variable selection has become increasingly important in analysis of neuroimaging data. For example, in the Autism Brain Imaging Data Exchange (ABIDE) study, neuroscientists are interested in identifying important biomarkers for early detection of the autism spectrum disorder (ASD) using high resolution brain images that include hundreds of thousands voxels. However, most existing methods are not feasible for solving this problem due to their extensive computational costs. In this work, we propose a novel multiresolution variable selection procedure under a Bayesian probit regression framework. It recursively uses posterior samples for coarser-scale variable selection to guide the posterior inference on finer-scale variable selection, leading to very efficient Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithms. The proposed algorithms are computationally feasible for ultra-high dimensional data. Also, our model incorporates two levels of structural information into variable selection using Ising priors: the spatial dependence between voxels and the functional connectivity between anatomical brain regions. Applied to the resting state functional magnetic resonance imaging (R-fMRI) data in the ABIDE study, our methods identify voxel-level imaging biomarkers highly predictive of the ASD, which are biologically meaningful and interpretable. Extensive simulations also show that our methods achieve better performance in variable selection compared to existing methods. © 2004-2012 IEEE.},\n",

      "abstract={Core features of autism spectrum disorder (ASD) may be underpinned by disrupted functional and structural neural connectivity. Abnormal fronto-parietal functional connectivity has been widely reported in the literature; this may be underpinned by disrupted microstructural organisation of white matter. The superior longitudinal fasciculus (SLF) is a major fronto-parietal white matter tract, the structure of which has been little studied in ASD. The fronto-parietal projections of this tract (SLF I, II and III) are thought to play an important role in a number of cognitive functions including attention and visuospatial processing. To date, the isolation of the fronto-parietal branches of the SLF has been hampered by limitations of traditional tractography approaches. Constrained spherical deconvolution (CSD)-based tractography is an advanced approach that allows valid isolation of the fronto-parietal branches of the SLF. Diffusion MRI data were acquired from 45 participants with ASD and 45 age- and IQ-matched controls. The SLF I, II and III branches were isolated using CSD-based tractography in ExploreDTI. Significantly greater fractional anisotropy (FA) was observed in the right SLF II relative to controls. The ASD group also showed greater linear diffusion coefficient in the left SLF I and the right SLF II. In the SLF II, the ASD group had significantly greater right lateralisation of FA in comparison with the control group. The clinical and functional implications of increased FA in white matter are poorly understood; however, it is possible that this increased white matter organisation in the SLF in ASD may contribute to relative processing advantages in the condition. © 2017 Federation of European Neuroscience Societies and John Wiley & Sons Ltd},\n",

      "abstract={Verbal–spatial discrepancies are common in healthy individuals and in those with neurodevelopmental disorders associated with cognitive control deficits including: Autism Spectrum Disorder, Non-Verbal Learning Disability, Fragile X, 22q11 deletion, and Turner Syndrome. Previous data from healthy individuals suggest that the magnitude of the difference between verbal IQ (VIQ) and performance IQ (PIQ) scores (the VIQ>PIQ discrepancy) is associated with reduced thickness in frontal and parietal cortices (inferior frontal, anterior cingulate, inferior parietal lobule, and supramarginal gyrus) that support cognitive control. Unknown is whether the VIQ>PIQ discrepancy is associated with functional deficits in these areas in healthy or ill children and adolescents. We assessed the effects of the VIQ>PIQ discrepancy on fMRI BOLD response during the resolution of cognitive conflict in 55 healthy children and adolescents during performance of a Simon Spatial Incompatibility task. As the magnitude of the VIQ>PIQ discrepancy increased, activation of fronto-striatal, limbic, and temporal regions decreased during conflict resolution (p <.05, corrected). In exploratory analyses, the VIQ>PIQ discrepancy was associated with reduced functional connectivity from right inferior frontal gyrus to right thalamus and increased functional connectivity to right supramarginal gyrus (ps <.03, uncorrected). The VIQ>PIQ discrepancy may be an important aspect of an individual's cognitive profile and likely contributes to, or is associated with, deficient cognitive control processes characteristic of many childhood disorders. © 2017 John Wiley & Sons Ltd},\n",

      "abstract={Background: Neurofibromatosis 1 (NF1) is a monogenic model for syndromic autism. Statins rescue the social and cognitive phenotype in animal knockout models, but translational trials with subjects > 8 years using cognition/behaviour outcomes have shown mixed results. This trial breaks new ground by studying statin effects for the first time in younger children with NF1 and co-morbid autism and by using multiparametric imaging outcomes. Methods: A single-site triple-blind RCT of simvastatin vs. placebo was done. Assessment (baseline and 12-week endpoint) included peripheral MAPK assay, awake magnetic resonance imaging spectroscopy (MRS; GABA and glutamate+glutamine (Glx)), arterial spin labelling (ASL), apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC), resting state functional MRI, and autism behavioural outcomes (Aberrant Behaviour Checklist and Clinical Global Impression). Results: Thirty subjects had a mean age of 8.1 years (SD 1.8). Simvastatin was well tolerated. The amount of imaging data varied by test. Simvastatin treatment was associated with (i) increased frontal white matter MRS GABA (t(12) = - 2.12, p =.055), GABA/Glx ratio (t(12) = - 2.78, p =.016), and reduced grey nuclei Glx (ANCOVA p < 0.05, Mann-Whitney p < 0.01); (ii) increased ASL perfusion in ventral diencephalon (Mann-Whitney p < 0.01); and (iii) decreased ADC in cingulate gyrus (Mann-Whitney p < 0.01). Machine-learning classification of imaging outcomes achieved 79% (p <.05) accuracy differentiating groups at endpoint against chance level (64%, p = 0.25) at baseline. Three of 12 (25%) simvastatin cases compared to none in placebo met 'clinical responder' criteria for behavioural outcome. Conclusions: We show feasibility of peripheral MAPK assay and autism symptom measurement, but the study was not powered to test effectiveness. Multiparametric imaging suggests possible simvastatin effects in brain areas previously associated with NF1 pathophysiology and the social brain network.

However, little is known about the neural processing of social decision making influenced by perceived gaze direction. Here, we employed functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) method to investigate 27 females when they were engaging in an economic exchange game task during which photos of direct or averted eye gaze were shown. We found that, when averted but not direct gaze was presented, prosocial vs. selfish choices were associated with stronger activations in the right superior temporal gyrus (STG) as well as larger functional couplings between right STG and the posterior cingulate cortex (PCC). Moreover, stronger activations in right STG was associated with quicker actions for making prosocial choice accompanied with averted gaze. The findings suggest that, when the cue implying social contact is absent, the processing of understanding others’ intention and the relationship between self and others is more involved for making prosocial than selfish decisions. These findings could advance our understanding of the roles of subtle cues in influencing prosocial decision making, as well as shedding lights on deficient social cue processing and functioning among individuals with autism spectrum disorder (ASD). © 2018 Sun, Shao, Wang and Lee.},\n",

      "abstract={Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is mainly reflected in the communication and language barriers, difficulties in social communication, and it is a kind of neurological developmental disorder. Most researches have used the machine learning method to classify patients and normal controls, among which support vector machines (SVM) are widely employed. But the classification accuracy of SVM is usually low, due to the usage of a single SVM as classifier. Thus, we used multiple SVMs to classify ASD patients and typical controls (TC). Resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data of 46 TC and 61 ASD patients were obtained from the Autism Brain Imaging Data Exchange (ABIDE) database. Only 84 of 107 subjects are utilized in experiments because the translation or rotation of 7 TC and 16 ASD patients has surpassed ±2 mm or ±2°. Then the random SVM cluster was proposed to distinguish TC and ASD. The results show that this method has an excellent classification performance based on all the features. Furthermore, the accuracy based on the optimal feature set could reach to 96.15%. Abnormal brain regions could also be found, such as inferior frontal gyrus (IFG) (orbital and opercula part), hippocampus, and precuneus. It is indicated that the method of random SVM cluster may apply to the auxiliary diagnosis of ASD. © 2018 Bi, Wang, Shu, Sun and Xu.},\n",

      "abstract={Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a neurodevelopmental disorder with prominent impairments in sociocommunicative abilities, which have been linked to anomalous brain network organization. Despite ample evidence of atypical long-distance connectivity, the literature on local connectivity remains small and divergent. We used resting-state functional MRI regional homogeneity (ReHo) as a local connectivity measure in comparative analyses across several well-matched low-motion subsamples from the Autism Brain Imaging Data Exchange and in-house data, with a grand total of 147 ASD and 184 typically developing (TD) participants, ages 7–18 years. We tested for group differences in each subsample, with additional focus on the difference between eyes-open and eyes-closed resting states. Despite selection of highest quality data and tight demographic and motion matching between groups and across samples, few effects in exactly identical loci (voxels) were found across samples. However, there was gross consistency across all eyes-open samples of local overconnectivity (ASD > TD) in posterior, visual regions. There was also gross consistency of local underconnectivity (ASD < TD) in cingulate gyrus, although exact loci varied between mid/posterior and anterior sections. While all eyes-open datasets showed the described gross similarities, the pattern of group differences for participants scanned with eyes closed was different, with local overconnectivity in ASD in posterior cingulate gyrus, but underconnectivity in some visual regions. Our findings suggest that fMRI local connectivity measures may be relatively susceptible to site and cohort variability and that some previous inconsistencies in the ASD ReHo literature may be reconciled by more careful consideration of eye status. © 2017, Springer Science+Business Media New York.},\n",

      "abstract={Aim: People with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) typically have deficits in the working memory (WM) system. WM is found to be an essential chain in successfully navigating in the social world. We hypothesize that brain networks for WM have an altered network integrity in ASD compared to controls. Methods: Thirteen adolescents (one female) with autistic disorder (n = 1), Asperger's disorder (n = 7), or pervasive developmental disorder not otherwise specified (n = 5), and 13 typically developing healthy control adolescents (one female) participated in this study. Functional magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was performed using an n-back task and in resting state. Results: The analysis of the behavioral data revealed deficits in WM performance in ASD, but only when tested to the limit. Adolescents with ASD showed lower binary global efficiency in the WM network than the healthy control group with n-back and resting-state data. This correlated with diagnostic scores for total problems, reciprocity, and language. Conclusion: Adolescents with higher-functioning autism have difficulty with the WM system, which is typically compensated. Functional MRI markers of brain network organization in ASD are related to characteristics of autism as represented in diagnostic scores. Therefore, functional MRI provides neuronal correlates for memory difficulties in adolescents with ASD. © 2017 The Authors.

      "abstract={Infant gross motor development is vital to adaptive function and predictive of both cognitive outcomes and neurodevelopmental disorders. However, little is known about neural systems underlying the emergence of walking and general gross motor abilities. Using resting state fcMRI, we identified functional brain networks associated with walking and gross motor scores in a mixed cross-sectional and longitudinal cohort of infants at high and low risk for autism spectrum disorder, who represent a dimensionally distributed range of motor function. At age 12 months, functional connectivity of motor and default mode networks was correlated with walking, whereas dorsal attention and posterior cingulo-opercular networks were implicated at age 24 months. Analyses of general gross motor function also revealed involvement of motor and default mode networks at 12 and 24 months, with dorsal attention, cingulo-opercular, frontoparietal, and subcortical networks additionally implicated at 24 months. These findings suggest that changes in network-level brain-behavior relationships underlie the emergence and consolidation of walking and gross motor abilities in the toddler period. This initial description of network substrates of early gross motor development may inform hypotheses regarding neural systems contributing to typical and atypical motor outcomes, as well as neurodevelopmental disorders associated with motor dysfunction. © The Author 2017.

      "abstract={Background/aims/methods While there are many benefits to regular engagement in physical activity, individuals with autism spectrum disorder often do not engage in healthy levels of physical activity. The purpose of this study was to compare praise delivered through multiple means on increasing engagement in physical activity for individuals with autism spectrum disorder. A single-case alternating treatment design was used to compare two conditions for delivering praise statements, in-person and through technology, for three young adults with autism spectrum disorder and accompanying intellectual disability. Procedures/outcomes The study consisted of training; baseline, comparison, best-treatment, thinning, and generalization phases; and social validity interviews. For each session, data were collected on the number of laps completed, duration, and resting/ending heart rates. Results/conclusions The number of laps completed increased for all participants during intervention, however, results were mixed regarding the more effective and preferred condition. Participants who excelled in the technology condition also maintained performance levels when praise statements were thinned and generalized performance to a new setting. Implications Praise statements can be used to increase levels of physical activity in young adults with autism spectrum disorder and intellectual disability. Exposing individuals to multiple conditions can impact their preferred method for receiving support. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd},\n",

      "abstract={Piaget's genetic epistemology has provided the constructivist approach upon which child developmental theories were founded, in that infants are thought to progress through distinct cognitive stages until they reach maturity in their early 20's. However, it is now well established that cognition continues to develop after early adulthood, and several \"neo-Piagetian\" theories have emerged in an attempt to better characterize adult cognitive development. For example, Kegan's Constructive Developmental Theory (CDT) argues that the thought processes used by adults to construct their reality change over time, and reaching higher stages of cognitive development entails becoming objectively aware of emotions and beliefs that were previously in the realm of the subconscious. In recent years, neuroscience has shown a growing interest in the biological substrates and neural mechanisms encompassing adult cognitive development, because psychological and psychiatric disorders can arise from deficiencies therein. In this article, we will use Kegan's CDT as a framework to discuss adult cognitive development in relation to closely correlated existing constructs underlying social processing, such as the perception of self and others. We will review the functional imaging and electrophysiologic evidence behind two key concepts relating to these posited developmental changes. These include self-related processing, a field that distinguishes between having conscious experiences (\"being a self\") and being aware of oneself having conscious experiences (\"being aware of being a self\"); and theory of mind, which is the objective awareness of possessing mental states such as beliefs and desires (i.e., having a \"mind\") and the understanding that others possess mental states that can be different from one's own. We shall see that cortical midline structures, including the medial prefrontal cortex and cingulate gyrus, as well as the temporal lobe, are associated with psychological tasks that test these models. In addition, we will review computational modeling approaches to cognitive development, and show how mathematical modeling can provide insights into how sometimes continuous changes in the neural processing substrate can give rise to relatively discrete developmental stages. Because deficiencies in adult cognitive development can result in disorders such as autism and depression, bridging the gaps between developmental psychology, neuroscience, and modeling has potential implications for clinical practice. As neuromodulation techniques such as deep brain and transcranial stimulation continue to advance, interfacing with these systems may lead to the emergence of novel investigational methods and therapeutic strategies in adults suffering from developmental disorders. © 2018 Girgis, Lee, Goodarzi and Ditterich.},\n",

Since asymmetry of the brain is also found in many vertebrates, we analyzed whether prenatal zinc deficient (PZD) mice, a mouse model with ASD like behavior, show alterations regarding brain lateralization on molecular and behavioral level. Our results show that hemisphere-specific expression of marker genes is abolished in PZD mice on mRNA and protein level. Using magnetic resonance imaging, we found an increased striatal volume in PZD mice with no change in total brain volume. Moreover, behavioral patterns associated with striatal lateralization are altered and the lateralized expression of dopamine receptor 1 (DR1) in the striatum of PZD mice was changed. We conclude that zinc signaling during brain development has a critical role in the establishment of brain lateralization in mice. © 2018 Grabrucker, Haderspeck, Sauer, Kittelberger, Asoglu, Abaei, Rasche, Schön, Boeckers and Grabrucker.},\n",

      "abstract={Functional MRI (fMRI) is modeled as a convolution of the hemodynamic response function (HRF) and an unmeasured latent neural signal. However, HRF itself is variable across brain regions and subjects. This variability is induced by both neural and non-neural factors. Aberrations in underlying neurochemical mechanisms, which control HRF shape, have been reported in autism spectrum disorders (ASD). Therefore, we hypothesized that this will lead to voxel-specific, yet systematic differences in HRF shape between ASD and healthy controls. As a corollary, we also hypothesized that such alterations will lead to differences in estimated functional connectivity in fMRI space compared to latent neural space. To test these hypotheses, we performed blind deconvolution of resting-state fMRI time series acquired from large number of ASD and control subjects obtained from the Autism Brain Imaging Data Exchange (ABIDE) database (N = 1102). Many brain regions previously implicated in autism showed systematic differences in HRF shape in ASD. Specifically, we found that precuneus had aberrations in all HRF parameters. Consequently, we obtained precuneus-seed-based functional connectivity differences between ASD and controls using fMRI as well as using latent neural signals. We found that non-deconvolved fMRI data failed to detect group differences in connectivity between precuneus and certain brain regions that were instead observed in deconvolved data. Our results are relevant for the understanding of hemodynamic and neurochemical aberrations in ASD, as well as have methodological implications for resting-state functional connectivity studies in Autism, and more generally in disorders that are accompanied by neurochemical alterations that may impact HRF shape. © 2018 The Authors},\n",

We investigated ASD patients brain imaging data from a world-wide multi-site database known as ABIDE (Autism Brain Imaging Data Exchange). ASD is a brain-based disorder characterized by social deficits and repetitive behaviors. According to recent Centers for Disease Control data, ASD affects one in 68 children in the United States. We investigated patterns of functional connectivity that objectively identify ASD participants from functional brain imaging data, and attempted to unveil the neural patterns that emerged from the classification. The results improved the state-of-the-art by achieving 70% accuracy in identification of ASD versus control patients in the dataset. The patterns that emerged from the classification show an anticorrelation of brain function between anterior and posterior areas of the brain; the anticorrelation corroborates current empirical evidence of anterior-posterior disruption in brain connectivity in ASD. We present the results and identify the areas of the brain that contributed most to differentiating ASD from typically developing controls as per our deep learning model. © 2017},\n",

A number of studies using resting state fMRI have shown that machine learning algorithms can distinguish between healthy controls and individuals diagnosed with either autism spectrum disorder or schizophrenia. However, it has not yet been determined whether machine learning algorithms can be used to distinguish between the two disorders. Using a linear support vector machine, we identify features that are most diagnostic for each disorder and successfully use them to classify an independent cohort of subjects. We find both common and divergent connectivity differences largely in the default mode network as well as in salience, and motor networks. Using divergent connectivity differences, we are able to distinguish autistic subjects from those with schizophrenia. Understanding the common and divergent connectivity changes associated with these disorders may provide a framework for understanding their shared cognitive deficits. © 2018},\n",

      "abstract={Selective or ‘picky’ eating habits are common among those with autism spectrum disorder (ASD). These behaviors are often related to aberrant sensory experience in individuals with ASD, including heightened reactivity to food taste and texture. However, very little is known about the neural mechanisms that underlie taste reactivity in ASD. In the present study, food-related neural responses were evaluated in 21 young adult and adolescent males diagnosed with ASD without intellectual disability, and 21 typically-developing (TD) controls. Taste reactivity was assessed using the Adolescent/Adult Sensory Profile, a clinical self-report measure. Functional magnetic resonance imaging was used to evaluate hemodynamic responses to sweet (vs. neutral) tastants and food pictures. Subjects also underwent resting-state functional connectivity scans. The ASD and TD individuals did not differ in their hemodynamic response to gustatory stimuli. However, the ASD subjects, but not the controls, exhibited a positive association between self-reported taste reactivity and the response to sweet tastants within the insular cortex and multiple brain regions associated with gustatory perception and reward. There was a strong interaction between diagnostic group and taste reactivity on tastant response in brain regions associated with ASD pathophysiology, including the bilateral anterior superior temporal sulcus (STS). This interaction of diagnosis and taste reactivity was also observed in the resting state functional connectivity between the anterior STS and dorsal mid-insula (i.e., gustatory cortex). These results suggest that self-reported heightened taste reactivity in ASD is associated with heightened brain responses to food-related stimuli and atypical functional connectivity of primary gustatory cortex, which may predispose these individuals to maladaptive and unhealthy patterns of selective eating behavior.

A key feature of population neuroimaging studies involves large-scale recruitment that is representative of the general population. One successful approach for population neuroimaging is to embed neuroimaging studies within large epidemiological cohorts. The Generation R Study is a large, prospective population-based birth-cohort in which nearly 10,000 pregnant mothers were recruited between 2002 and 2006 with repeated measurements in the children and their parents over time. Magnetic resonance imaging was included in 2009 with the scanning of 1070 6-to-9-year-old children. The second neuroimaging wave was initiated in April 2013 with a total of 4245 visiting the MRI suite and 4087 9-to-11-year-old children being scanned. The sequences included high-resolution structural MRI, 35-direction diffusion weighted imaging, and a 6 min and 2 s resting-state functional MRI scan. The goal of this paper is to provide an overview of the imaging protocol and the overlap between the neuroimaging data and metadata. We conclude by providing a brief overview of results from our first wave of neuroimaging, which highlights a diverse array of questions that can be addressed by merging the fields of developmental neuroscience and epidemiology. © 2017, The Author(s).},\n",

We assessed RB symptomatology in 50 ASD and 52 typically developing (TD) children and adolescents (ages 8-17 years), examining intrinsic functional connectivity (iFC) of corticostriatal circuitry, which is important for reward-based learning and integration of emotional, cognitive and motor processing, and considered impaired in ASDs. Connectivity analyses were performed for three functionally distinct striatal seeds (limbic, frontoparietal and motor). Functional connectivity with cortical regions of interest was assessed for corticostriatal circuit connectivity indices and ratios, testing the balance of connectivity between circuits. Results showed corticostriatal overconnectivity of limbic and frontoparietal seeds, but underconnectivity of motor seeds. Correlations with RBs were found for connectivity between the striatal motor seeds and cortical motor clusters from the whole-brain analysis, and for frontoparietal/limbic and motor/limbic connectivity ratios. Division of ASD participants into high (n=17) and low RB subgroups (n=19) showed reduced frontoparietal/limbic and motor/limbic circuit ratios for high RB compared to low RB and TD groups in the right hemisphere. Results suggest an association between RBs and an imbalance of corticostriatal iFC in ASD, being increased for limbic, but reduced for frontoparietal and motor circuits. © The Author (2017).},\n",

Alterations in network connectivity are widely recognized, but their interplay with social and sensory symptoms remains largely unclear. Here, functional magnetic resonance imaging and diagnostic and behavioral assessments were used in a cohort of children and adolescents with ASD (n = 40) and matched typically developing (TD, n = 38) controls to examine the relation between auditory processing, interhemispheric and thalamocortical network connectivity, and social-behavioral symptom severity. We found that atypical processing of sounds was related to social, cognitive, and communicative impairments. Additionally, severity of sensory processing deficits and lower verbal IQ were related to reduced interhemispheric connectivity of auditory cortices in ASD. Increased connectivity between the thalamus and auditory cortex in ASD, however, was associated with reduced cognitive and behavioral symptomatology, suggesting that thalamocortical overconnectivity might reflect a compensatory mechanism in ASD. These findings provide novel evidence for links between auditory sensory deficits and impairments in social interaction and communication. © 2017 The Authors},\n",

This longitudinal study prospectively followed infants at heightened risk for autism spectrum disorder (ASD) based on their status as younger siblings of children diagnosed with ASD (Sibs-ASD) and infants at relatively lower risk for ASD (siblings of typically developing children; Sibs-TD) to examine the developmental sequelae and possible neurophysiological substrates of a specific sensory response pattern: unusually intense interest in nonsocial sensory stimuli or “sensory seeking.” At 18 months, sensory seeking and social orienting were measured with the Sensory Processing Assessment, and a potential neural signature for sensory seeking (i.e., frontal alpha asymmetry) was measured via resting state electroencephalography. At 36 months, infants’ social symptomatology was assessed in a comprehensive diagnostic evaluation. Sibs-ASD showed elevated sensory seeking relative to Sibs-TD, and increased sensory seeking was concurrently associated with reduced social orienting across groups and resting frontal asymmetry in Sibs-ASD. Sensory seeking also predicted later social symptomatology. Findings suggest that sensory seeking may produce cascading effects on social development in infants at risk for ASD and that atypical frontal asymmetry may underlie this atypical pattern of sensory responsiveness. © 2017 The Authors},\n",

      "abstract={Investigation of the brain's functional connectome can improve our understanding of how an individual brain's organizational changes influence cognitive function and could result in improved individual risk stratification. Brain connectome studies in adults and older children have shown that abnormal network properties may be useful as discriminative features and have exploited machine learning models for early diagnosis in a variety of neurological conditions. However, analogous studies in neonates are rare and with limited significant findings. In this paper, we propose an artificial neural network (ANN) framework for early prediction of cognitive deficits in very preterm infants based on functional connectome data from resting state fMRI. Specifically, we conducted feature selection via stacked sparse autoencoder and outcome prediction via support vector machine (SVM). The proposed ANN model was unsupervised learned using brain connectome data from 884 subjects in autism brain imaging data exchange database and SVM was cross-validated on 28 very preterm infants (born at 23–31 weeks of gestation and without brain injury; scanned at term-equivalent postmenstrual age). Using 90 regions of interests, we found that the ANN model applied to functional connectome data from very premature infants can predict cognitive outcome at 2 years of corrected age with an accuracy of 70.6% and area under receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.76. We also noted that several frontal lobe and somatosensory regions, significantly contributed to prediction of cognitive deficits 2 years later. Our work can be considered as a proof of concept for utilizing ANN models on functional connectome data to capture the individual variability inherent in the developing brains of preterm infants.

      "abstract={Cyclin-dependent kinase-like 5 (CDKL5) is an X-linked gene encoding a serine-threonine kinase that is highly expressed in the central nervous system. Mutations in CDKL5 cause neurological and psychiatric symptoms, including early-onset seizures, motor dysfunction, autistic features and sleep breathing abnormalities in patients. It remains to be addressed whether loss of CDKL5 causes respiratory dysfunction in mice. Here, we examined the respiratory pattern of male Cdkl5−/y mice at 1–3 months of age during resting breathing and respiratory challenge (i.e., hypoxia and hypercapnia) via whole body plethysmography. The results demonstrated that the resting respiratory frequency and tidal volume of Cdkl5−/y mice was unaltered compared to that of WT mice at 1 month of age. However, these mutant mice exhibit transient reduction in tidal volume during respiratory challenge even the reduction was restored at 2 months of age. Notably, the sigh-breathing pattern was changed in Cdkl5−/y mice, showing a transient reduction in sigh volume at 1–2 month of age and long-term attenuation of peak expiratory airflow from 1 to 3 month of age. Therefore, loss of CDKL5 causes breathing deficiency, supporting a CDKL5-mediated regulation of respiratory function in mice. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.},\n",

      "abstract={Extensive studies have indicated brain function connectivity abnormalities in autism spectrum disorder (ASD). However, there is a lack of longitudinal or cross-sectional research focused on tracking age-related developmental trends of autistic children at an early stage of brain development or based on a relatively large sample. The present study examined brain network changes in a total of 186 children both with and without ASD from 3 to 11 years, an early and key development period when significant changes are expected. The study aimed to investigate possible abnormal connectivity patterns and topological properties of children with ASD from early childhood to late childhood by using resting-state electroencephalographic (EEG) data. The main findings of the study were as follows: (1) From the connectivity analysis, several inter-regional synchronizations with reduction were identified in the younger and older ASD groups, and several intra-regional synchronization increases were observed in the older ASD group. (2) From the graph analysis, a reduced clustering coefficient and enhanced mean shortest path length in specific frequencies was observed in children with ASD. (3) Results suggested an age-related decrease of the mean shortest path length in the delta and theta bands in TD children, whereas atypical age-related alteration was observed in the ASD group. In addition, graph measures were correlated with ASD symptom severity in the alpha band. These results demonstrate that abnormal neural communication is already present at the early stages of brain development in autistic children and this may be involved in the behavioral deficits associated with ASD. © 2017 IBRO},\n",

      "abstract={Most of the existing behavioral and cognitive intervention programs in autism spectrum disorders (ASD) have not been tested at the neurobiological level, thus falling short of finding quantifiable neurobiological changes underlying behavioral improvement. The current study takes a translational neuroimaging approach to test the impact of a structured visual imagery-based reading intervention on improving reading comprehension and assessing its underlying local neural circuitry. Behavioral and resting state functional MRI (rs-fMRI) data were collected from children with ASD who were randomly assigned to an Experimental group (ASD-EXP; n = 14) and a Wait-list control group (ASD-WLC; n = 14). Participants went through an established reading intervention training program (Visualizing and Verbalizing for language comprehension and thinking or V/V; 4-h per day, 10-weeks, 200 h of face-to-face instruction). Local functional connectivity was examined using a connection density approach from graph theory focusing on brain areas considered part of the Reading Network. The main results are as follows: (I) the ASD-EXP group showed significant improvement, compared to the ASD-WLC group, in their reading comprehension ability evidenced from change in comprehension scores; (II) the ASD-EXP group showed increased local brain connectivity in Reading Network regions compared to the ASD-WLC group post-intervention; (III) intervention-related changes in local brain connectivity were observed in the ASD-EXP from pre to post-intervention; and (IV) improvement in language comprehension significantly predicted changes in local connectivity. The findings of this study provide novel insights into brain plasticity in children with developmental disorders using targeted intervention programs. © 2017},\n",

      "abstract={Cerebellar abnormalities, particularly in Right Crus I (RCrusI), are consistently reported in autism spectrum disorders (ASD). Although RCrusI is functionally connected with ASD-implicated circuits, the contribution of RCrusI dysfunction to ASD remains unclear. Here neuromodulation of RCrusI in neurotypical humans resulted in altered functional connectivity with the inferior parietal lobule, and children with ASD showed atypical functional connectivity in this circuit. Atypical RCrusI-inferior parietal lobule structural connectivity was also evident in the Purkinje neuron (PN) TscI ASD mouse model. Additionally, chemogenetically mediated inhibition of RCrusI PN activity in mice was sufficient to generate ASD-related social, repetitive, and restricted behaviors, while stimulation of RCrusI PNs rescued social impairment in the PN TscI ASD mouse model. Together, these studies reveal important roles for RCrusI in ASD-related behaviors. Further, the rescue of social behaviors in an ASD mouse model suggests that investigation of the therapeutic potential of cerebellar neuromodulation in ASD may be warranted. © 2017 The Author(s).},\n",

      "abstract={The neurobiological basis of social dysfunction and the high male prevalence in autism spectrum disorder (ASD) remain poorly understood. Although network alterations presumably underlie the development of autistic-like behaviors, a clear pattern of connectivity differences specific to ASD has not yet emerged. Because the heterogeneous nature of ASD hinders investigations in human subjects, we explored brain connectivity in an etiologically homogenous rat model of ASD induced by exposure to valproic acid (VPA) in utero. We performed partial correlation analysis of cross-sectional resting-state 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography scans from VPA-exposed and control rats to estimate metabolic connectivity and conducted canonical correlation analysis of metabolic activity and behavior scores. VPA-Treated rats exhibited impairments in social behaviors, and this difference was more pronounced in male than female rats. Similarly, current analyses revealed sex-specific changes in network connectivity and identified distinct alterations in the distributed metabolic activity patterns associated with autistic-like social deficits. Specifically, diminished activity in the salience network and enhanced activity in a cortico-cerebellar circuit correlated with the severity of social behavioral deficits. Such metabolic connectivity features may represent neurobiological substrates of autistic-like behavior, particularly in males, and may serve as a pathognomonic sign in the VPA rat model of ASD. © 2017 The Author(s).},\n",

      "abstract={Background Brain connectivity in autism spectrum disorders (ASD) has proven difficult to characterize due to the heterogeneous nature of the spectrum. Connectivity in the brain occurs in a complex, multilevel and multi-temporal manner, driving the fluctuations observed in local oxygen demand. These fluctuations can be characterized as fractals, as they auto-correlate at different time scales. In this study, we propose a model-free complexity analysis based on the fractal dimension of the rs-BOLD signal, acquired with magnetic resonance imaging. The fractal dimension can be interpreted as measure of signal complexity and connectivity. Previous studies have suggested that reduction in signal complexity can be associated with disease. Therefore, we hypothesized that a detectable difference in rs-BOLD signal complexity could be observed between ASD patients and Controls. Methods and findings Anatomical and functional data from fifty-five subjects with ASD (12.7 ± 2.4 y/o) and 55 age-matched (14.1 ± 3.1 y/o) healthy controls were accessed through the NITRC database and the ABIDE project. Subjects were scanned using a 3T GE Signa MRI and a 32-channel RF-coil. Axial FSPGR-3D images were used to prescribe rs-BOLD (TE/TR = 30/2000ms) where 300 time points were acquired. Motion correction was performed on the functional data and anatomical and functional images were aligned and spatially warped to the N27 standard brain atlas. Fractal analysis, performed on a grey matter mask, was done by estimating the Hurst exponent in the frequency domain using a power spectral density approach and refining the estimation in the time domain with de-trended fluctuation analysis and signal summation conversion methods. Voxel-wise fractal dimension (FD) was calculated for every subject in the control group and in the ASD group to create ROI-based Z-scores for the ASD patients. Voxel-wise validation of FD normality across controls was confirmed, and non-Gaussian voxels were eliminated from subsequent analysis. To maintain a 95% confidence level, only regions where Z-score values were at least 2 standard deviations away from the mean (i.e. where |Z| > 2.0) were included in the analysis. We found that the main regions, where signal complexity significantly decreased among ASD patients, were the amygdala (p = 0.001), the vermis (p = 0.02), the basal ganglia (p = 0.01) and the hippocampus (p = 0.02). No regions reported significant increase in signal complexity in this study. Our findings were correlated with ADIR and ADOS assessment tools, reporting the highest correlation with the ADOS metrics. Conclusions Brain connectivity is best modeled as a complex system. Therefore, a measure of complexity as the fractal dimension of fluctuations in brain oxygen demand and utilization could provide important information about connectivity issues in ASD. Moreover, this technique can be used in the characterization of a single subject, with respect to controls, without the need for group analysis. Our novel approach provides an ideal avenue for personalized diagnostics, thus providing unique patient specific assessment that could help in individualizing treatments. © 2017 Dona et al.

      "abstract={Interhemispheric functional connectivity abnormalities are often reported in autism and it is thus not surprising that structural defects of the corpus callosum (CC) are consistently found using both traditional MRI and DTI techniques. Past DTI studies however, have subdivided the CC into 2 or 3 segments without regard for where fibers may project to within the cortex, thus placing limitations on our ability to understand the nature, timing and neurobehavioral impact of early CC abnormalities in autism. Leveraging a unique cohort of 97 toddlers (68 autism; 29 typical) we utilized a novel technique that identified seven CC tracts according to their cortical projections. Results revealed that younger (<2.5 years old), but not older toddlers with autism exhibited abnormally low mean, radial, and axial diffusivity values in the CC tracts connecting the occipital lobes and the temporal lobes. Fractional anisotropy and the cross sectional area of the temporal CC tract were significantly larger in young toddlers with autism. These findings indicate that water diffusion is more restricted and unidirectional in the temporal CC tract of young toddlers who develop autism. Such results may be explained by a potential overabundance of small caliber axons generated by excessive prenatal neural proliferation as proposed by previous genetic, animal model, and postmortem studies of autism. Furthermore, early diffusion measures in the temporal CC tract of the young toddlers were correlated with outcome measures of autism severity at later ages. These findings regarding the potential nature, timing, and location of early CC abnormalities in autism add to accumulating evidence, which suggests that altered inter-hemispheric connectivity, particularly across the temporal lobes, is a hallmark of the disorder. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd},\n",

      "abstract={Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a heterogeneous condition that affects 1 in 68 children. Diagnosis is based on the presence of characteristic behavioral impairments that emerge in the second year of life and thus is not typically made until 3 to 4 years of age. Recent studies of early brain and behavior development have provided important new insights into the nature of this condition. Autism-specific brain imaging features have been identified as early as 6 months of age, and age-specific brain and behavior changes have been demonstrated across the first 2 years of life, highlighting the developmental nature of ASD. New findings demonstrate that early brain imaging in the first year of life holds great promise for presymptomatic prediction of ASD. There is a general understanding in medicine that earlier treatment has better outcomes than later treatment, and in autism, there is an emerging consensus that earlier intervention results in more successful outcomes for the child. Examining early brain and behavior trajectories also has the potential to parse the etiologic heterogeneity in ASD, a well-recognized impediment to developing targeted, mechanistic treatments. This review highlights the current state of the science in the pursuit of early brain and behavioral markers of autism during infancy and examines the potential implications of these findings for treatment of this condition. © 2017 AICH - Servier Research Group.},\n",

This study investigated whether and how the brain networks in children with ASD were abnormally organized with resting state EEG. Temporal synchronization analysis was first applied to capture the aberrant brain connectivity. Then brain network topology was characterized by three graph analysis methods including the commonly-used weighted and binary graph, as well as minimum spanning tree (MST). Whole brain connectivity in ASD group was found to be significantly reduced in theta and alpha band compared to typically development children (TD). Weighted graph found significantly decreased path length together with marginally significantly decreased clustering coefficient in ASD in alpha band, indicating a loss of small-world architecture to a random network. Such abnormal network topology was also demonstrated in the binary graph. In MST analysis, children with ASD showed a significant lower leaf fractions with a decrease trend of tree hierarchy in the alpha band, suggesting a shift towards line-like decentralized organization in ASD. The altered brain network may offer an insight into the underlying pathology of ASD and possibly serve as a biomarker that may aid in diagnosis of ASD. © 2017 The Author(s).},\n",

      "abstract={Sensory dysfunction is a core symptom of autism spectrum disorder (ASD), and abnormalities with sensory responsivity and processing can be extremely debilitating to ASD patients and their families. However, relatively little is known about the underlying neuroanatomical and neurophysiological factors that lead to sensory abnormalities in ASD. Investigation into these aspects of ASD could lead to significant advancements in our general knowledge about ASD, as well as provide targets for treatment and inform diagnostic procedures. Thus, the current study aimed to measure the covariation of volumes of brain structures (i.e., structural magnetic resonance imaging) that may be involved in abnormal sensory processing, in order to infer connectivity of these brain regions. Specifically, we quantified the structural covariation of sensory-related cerebral cortical structures, in addition to the cerebellum and amygdala by computing partial correlations between the structural volumes of these structures. These analyses were performed in participants with ASD (n = 36), as well as typically developing peers (n = 32). Results showed decreased structural covariation between sensory-related cortical structures, especially between the left and right cerebral hemispheres, in participants with ASD. In contrast, these same participants presented with increased structural covariation of structures in the right cerebral hemisphere. Additionally, sensory-related cerebral structures exhibited decreased structural covariation with functionally identified cerebellar networks. Also, the left amygdala showed significantly increased structural covariation with cerebral structures related to visual processing. Taken together, these results may suggest several patterns of altered connectivity both within and between cerebral cortices and other brain structures that may be related to sensory processing. © 2017 Cardon, Hepburn and Rojas.},\n",

      "abstract={Background Emerging evidence suggests disruptions in the wiring organization of the brain's network in schizophrenia (SZ) and bipolar disorder (BD). As the importance of genetic predisposition has been firmly established in these illnesses, children (offspring) of patients constitute an at-risk population. This study examines connectome organization in children at familial high risk for psychosis. Methods Diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging scans were collected from 127 nonpsychotic offspring 8 to 18 years of age (average age = 13.5 years) of a parent diagnosed with SZ (SZ offspring; n = 28) or BD (BD offspring; N = 60) and community control subjects (n = 39). Resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging scans were available for 82 subjects. Anatomical and functional brain networks were reconstructed and examined using graph theoretical analysis. Results SZ offspring were found to show connectivity deficits of the brain's central rich club (RC) system relative to both control subjects and BD offspring. The disruption in anatomical RC connectivity in SZ offspring was associated with increased modularity of the functional connectome. In addition, increased coupling between structural and functional connectivity of long-distance connections was observed in both SZ offspring and BD offspring. Conclusions This study shows lower levels of anatomical RC connectivity in nonpsychotic young offspring of SZ patients. This finding suggests that the brain's anatomical RC system is affected in at-risk youths, reflecting a connectome signature of familial risk for psychotic illness. Moreover, finding no RC deficits in offspring of BD patients suggest a differential effect of genetic predisposition for SZ versus BD on the developmental formation of the connectome. © 2017 Society of Biological Psychiatry},\n",

      "abstract={In interactive social situations, it is often crucial to be able to take another person’s perspective when evaluating one’s own or another person’s specific trait; individuals with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) critically lack this social skill. To examine how perspective-dependent self- and other-evaluation processes modulate functional connectivity in ASD, we conducted a functional magnetic resonance imaging study in which 26 high-functioning adults with ASD and 24 typically developed (TD) controls were asked to decide whether an adjective describing a personality trait correctly described the participant himself/herself (“self”) or the participant’s mother (“other”) by taking either the first (1P) or third person (3P) perspective. We observed that functional connectivity between the left sensorimotor cortex and the left middle cingulate cortex was enhanced in TD control individuals taking the 3P perspective, this enhancement was significantly reduced in ASD, and the degree of reduction was significantly correlated with the severity of autistic traits. Furthermore, the self-reference effect on functional connectivity between the left inferior frontal cortex and frontopolar cortices was significantly enhanced in TD control individuals taking the 3P perspective, whereas such effect was reversed in ASD. These findings indicate altered effects of perspective on the functional connectivity, which may underlie the deficits in social interaction and communication observed in individuals with ASD. © 2016 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.},\n",

      "abstract={Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a neurodevelopmental condition associated with altered brain connectivity. Previous neuroimaging research demonstrates inconsistent results, particularly in studies of functional connectivity in ASD. Typically, these inconsistent findings are results of studies using static measures of resting-state functional connectivity. Recent work has demonstrated that functional brain connections are dynamic, suggesting that static connectivity metrics fail to capture nuanced time-varying properties of functional connections in the brain. Here we used a dynamic functional connectivity approach to examine the differences in the strength and variance of dynamic functional connections between individuals with ASD and healthy controls (HCs). The variance of dynamic functional connections was defined as the respective standard deviations of the dynamic functional connectivity strength across time. We utilized a large multicenter dataset of 507 male subjects (209 with ASD and 298 HC, from 6 to 36 years old) from the Autism Brain Imaging Data Exchange (ABIDE) to identify six distinct whole-brain dynamic functional connectivity states. Analyses demonstrated greater variance of widespread long-range dynamic functional connections in ASD (P < 0.05, NBS method) and weaker dynamic functional connections in ASD (P < 0.05, NBS method) within specific whole-brain connectivity states. Hypervariant dynamic connections were also characterized by weaker connectivity strength in ASD compared with HC. Increased variance of dynamic functional connections was also related to ASD symptom severity (ADOS total score) (P < 0.05), and was most prominent in connections related to the medial superior frontal gyrus and temporal pole. These results demonstrate that greater intraindividual dynamic variance is a potential biomarker of ASD.

      "abstract={Schizophrenia and autism spectrum disorder (ASD) are two prevalent neurodevelopmental disorders sharing some similar genetic basis and clinical features. The extent to which they share common neural substrates remains unclear. Resting-state fMRI data were collected from 35 drug-naïve adolescent participants with first-episode schizophrenia (15.6 ± 1.8 years old) and 31 healthy controls (15.4 ± 1.6 years old). Data from 22 participants with ASD (13.1 ± 3.1 years old) and 21 healthy controls (12.9 ± 2.9 years old) were downloaded from the Autism Brain Imaging Data Exchange. Resting-state functional networks were constructed using predefined regions of interest. Multivariate pattern analysis combined with multi-task regression feature selection methods were conducted in two datasets separately. Classification between individuals with disorders and controls was achieved with high accuracy (schizophrenia dataset: accuracy = 83%; ASD dataset: accuracy = 80%). Shared atypical brain connections contributing to classification were mostly present in the default mode network (DMN) and salience network (SN). These functional connections were further related to severity of social deficits in ASD (p = 0.002). Distinct atypical connections were also more related to the DMN and SN, but showed different atypical connectivity patterns between the two disorders. These results suggest some common neural mechanisms contributing to schizophrenia and ASD, and may aid in understanding the pathology of these two neurodevelopmental disorders.

      "abstract={Despite countless studies on autism spectrum disorder (ASD), diagnosis relies on specific behavioral criteria and neuroimaging biomarkers for the disorder are still relatively scarce and irrelevant for diagnostic workup. Many researchers have focused on functional networks of brain activities using resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rsfMRI) to diagnose brain diseases, including ASD. Although some existing methods are able to reveal the abnormalities in functional networks, they are either highly dependent on prior assumptions for modeling these networks or do not focus on latent functional connectivities (FCs) by considering discriminative relations among FCs in a nonlinear way. In this article, we propose a novel framework to model multiple networks of rsfMRI with data-driven approaches. Specifically, we construct large-scale functional networks with hierarchical clustering and find discriminative connectivity patterns between ASD and normal controls (NC). We then learn features and classifiers for each cluster through discriminative restricted Boltzmann machines (DRBMs). In the testing phase, each DRBM determines whether a test sample is ASD or NC, based on which we make a final decision with a majority voting strategy. We assess the diagnostic performance of the proposed method using public datasets and describe the effectiveness of our method by comparing it to competing methods. We also rigorously analyze FCs learned by DRBMs on each cluster and discover dominant FCs that play a major role in discriminating between ASD and NC.

      "abstract={Spatial normalization of brains to a standardized space is a widely used approach for group studies in functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data. Commonly used template-based approaches are complicated by signal dropout and distortions in echo planar imaging (EPI) data. The most widely used software packages implement two common template-based strategies: (1) affine transformation of the EPI data to an EPI template followed by nonlinear registration to an EPI template (EPInorm) and (2) affine transformation of the EPI data to the anatomic image for a given subject, followed by nonlinear registration of the anatomic data to an anatomic template, which produces a transformation that is applied to the EPI data (T1norm). EPI distortion correction can be used to adjust for geometric distortion of EPI relative to the T1 images. However, in practice, this EPI distortion correction step is often skipped. We compare these template-based strategies empirically in four large datasets. We find that the EPInorm approach consistently shows reduced variability across subjects, especially in the case when distortion correction is not applied. EPInorm also shows lower estimates for coregistration distances among subjects (i.e., within-dataset similarity is higher). Finally, the EPInorm approach shows higher T values in a task-based dataset. Thus, the EPInorm approach appears to amplify the power of the sample compared to the T1norm approach when not using distortion correction (i.e., the EPInorm boosts the effective sample size by 12–25%). In sum, these results argue for the use of EPInorm over the T1norm when no distortion correction is used.

      "abstract={Motivated by applications in neuroimaging analysis, we propose a new regression model, Sparse TensOr REsponse regression (STORE), with a tensor response and a vector predictor. STORE embeds two key sparse structures: element-wise sparsity and low-rankness. It can handle both a non-symmetric and a symmetric tensor response, and thus is applicable to both structural and functional neuroimaging data. We formulate the parameter estimation as a non-convex optimization problem, and develop an efficient alternating updating algorithm. We establish a non-asymptotic estimation error bound for the actual estimator obtained from the proposed algorithm. This error bound reveals an interesting interaction between the computational efficiency and the statistical rate of convergence. When the distribution of the error tensor is Gaussian, we further obtain a fast estimation error rate which allows the tensor dimension to grow exponentially with the sample size. We illustrate the efficacy of our model through intensive simulations and an analysis of the Autism spectrum disorder neuroimaging data. © 2017 Will Wei Sun and Lexin Li.},\n",

      "abstract={Purpose About 80% of children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) have sleep problems that may disrupt optimal family functioning. We explored the impact of sleep problems on families′ resilience. Design and Methods An explanatory sequential mixed methods design was used to discern whether resilience differed between families whose children with ASD have or do not have sleep problems, to seek predictors for family hardiness/resilience, and to determine whether narrative findings support, expand, or conflict quantitative findings. Results Seventy complete surveys were returned from parents of children with ASD to compare sleep and family functioning. Fifty-seven children had sleep problems and six interviews regarding eight of these children were conducted. Parents of children with ASD and sleep problems had lower levels of resilience than those who slept well. Predictors of hardiness were social support, coping-coherence (stress management), and lower strain scores. Qualitative content analysis revealed a journey analogy with themes: finding the trailhead, dual pathways, crossing paths and choosing travel companions, forging new paths, resting along the way, and seeing the vistas. Conclusions Qualitative findings supported quantitative findings regarding the impact of sleep problems but also expanded them by illustrating how families′ resilience and children's socialization improved over time. Social support predicted family hardiness. Parents revealed that sleep issues contributed to family strains and described their progression to resilience and embracing their child. Practice Implications Findings support the need for community and provider advocacy and implicates a need for development of sleep interventions on behalf of families and children with ASD. © 2017 Elsevier Inc.},\n",

      "abstract={Although evidence is accumulating that autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is associated with disruption of functional connections between and within brain networks, it remains largely unknown whether these abnormalities are related to specific frequency bands. To address this question, network contingency analysis was performed on brain functional connectomes obtained from 213 adolescent participants across nine sites in the Autism Brain Imaging Data Exchange (ABIDE) multisite sample, to determine the disrupted connections between and within seven major cortical networks in adolescents with ASD at Slow-5, Slow-4 and Slow-3 frequency bands and further assess whether the aberrant intra- and inter-network connectivity varied as a function of ASD symptoms. Overall under-connectivity within and between large-scale intrinsic networks in ASD was revealed across the three frequency bands. Specifically, decreased connectivity strength within the default mode network (DMN), between DMN and visual network (VN), ventral attention network (VAN), and between dorsal attention network (DAN) and VAN was observed in the lower frequency band (slow-5, slow-4), while decreased connectivity between limbic network (LN) and frontal-parietal network (FPN) was observed in the higher frequency band (slow-3). Furthermore, weaker connectivity within and between specific networks correlated with poorer communication and social interaction skills in the slow-5 band, uniquely. These results demonstrate intrinsic under-connectivity within and between multiple brain networks within predefined frequency bands in ASD, suggesting that frequency-related properties underlie abnormal brain network organization in the disorder. © 2017},\n",

      "abstract={Diagnosis of autism spectrum disorder (ASD) currently relies on behavioral observations because brain markers are unknown. Machine learning approaches can identify patterns in imaging data that predict diagnostic status, but most studies using functional connectivity MRI (fcMRI) data achieved only modest accuracies of 60-80%. We used conditional random forest (CRF), an ensemble learning technique protected against bias from feature correlation (which exists in fcMRI matrices). We selected 252 low-motion resting-state functional MRI scans from the Autism Brain Imaging Data Exchange, including 126 typically developing (TD) and 126 ASD participants, matched for age, nonverbal IQ, and head motion. A matrix of functional connectivities between 220 functionally defined regions of interest was used for diagnostic classification. In several runs, we achieved accuracies of 92-99% for classifiers with >300 features (most informative connections). Features, including pericentral somatosensory and motor regions, were disproportionately informative. Findings differed partially from a previous study in the same sample that used feature selection with random forest (which is biased by feature correlations). External validation in a smaller in-house data set, however, achieved only 67-71% accuracy. The large number of features in optimal models can be attributed to etiological heterogeneity under the clinical ASD umbrella. Lower accuracy in external validation is expected due to differences in unknown composition of ASD variants across samples. High accuracy in the main data set is unlikely due to noise overfitting, but rather indicates optimized characterization of a given cohort. © Copyright 2017, Mary Ann Liebert, Inc..},\n",

We compared 20 preterm infants, born at <34 weeks of gestation with abnormal antenatal Doppler measurements and birth weights <10th percentile, with 20 appropriate for gestational age preterm infants of similar gestational age and 20 term infants. They were scanned without sedation at 12 months of age and screened for autistic traits at 26 months. Resting functional connectivity was assessed using group independent component analysis and seed-based correlation analysis. The groups showed 10 common resting-state networks involving cortical, subcortical regions, and the cerebellum. Only infants with FGR showed patterns of increased connectivity in the visual network and decreased connectivity in the auditory/language and dorsal attention networks. No significant differences between groups were found using seed-based correlation analysis. FGR infants displayed a higher frequency of early autism features, related to decreased connectivity involving the salience network, than term infants. These data suggest that FGR is an independent risk factor for disrupted intrinsic functional connectivity in preterm infants when they are 1-year old and provide more clues about the neurodevelopmental abnormalities reported in this population. © The Author 2016.

      "abstract={Background Autism-like symptoms in the non-clinical general population are referred to as the broad autism phenotype (BAP). To date there have been no studies investigating how BAP might correlate with measurements from the resting-state electroencephalogram (EEG). Method EEG resting-state data were collected in 20 young adults during both eyes-closed (EC) and eyes-open (EO) resting states. Permutation modelling was used to assess correlations of the Broad Autism Phenotype Questionnaire (BAPQ) with source localised resting alpha activity. Results Total scores on the BAPQ were strongly correlated with differences between oscillatory brain activity during EC and EO rest in a pattern that was classified as the mu rhythm. More mu activity during EC rest compared to EO rest was found to be associated with higher BAPQ scores (i.e. more prominent BAP symptoms). Conclusions Mu is a known correlate of activity in the mirror neuron system (MNS), which has been implicated in the social deficits associated with autism. It is therefore suggested that this BAPQ-correlated mu activity could reflect the readying of the MNS for social input by visual stimulation. These findings offer novel insights into how the BAP is reflected in resting-state recordings of brain activity. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd},\n",

Mutations in Synapsin (SYN) genes, particularly SYN1 and SYN2, have been recently associated with ASD and epilepsy in humans. Accordingly, mice lacking Syn1 or Syn2, but not Syn3, experience epileptic seizures and display autistic-like traits that precede the onset of seizures. Here, we analyzed social behavior and ultrasonic vocalizations emitted in 2 social contexts by SynI, SynII, or SynIII mutants and show that SynII mutants display the most severe ASD-like phenotype. We also show that the behavioral SynII phenotype correlates with a significant decrease in auditory and hippocampal functional connectivity as measured with resting state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rsfMRI). Taken together, our results reveal a permissive contribution of Syn2 to the expression of normal socio-communicative behavior, and suggest that Syn2-mediated synaptic dysfunction can lead to ASD-like behavior through dysregulation of cortical connectivity. © The Author 2017.

      "abstract={The beta-adrenergic antagonist propranolol benefits some social and communication domains affected in autism spectrum disorder (ASD), and these benefits appear to be associated with increased functional connectivity (FC) in the brain during task performance. FC is implicated in ASD, with the majority of studies suggesting long distance hypo-connectivity combined with regionally specific local hyper-connectivity. The objective in the current investigation was to examine the effect of propranolol on FC at rest and determine whether ASD-specific effects exist. Participants with and without ASD attended three sessions in which propranolol, nadolol (a beta-adrenergic antagonist that does not cross the blood-brain barrier), or placebo were administered. Resting-state fMRI data were acquired, and graph theory techniques were utilized to assess additional aspects of FC. Compared to placebo, propranolol administration was associated with decreased FC in the dorsal medial prefrontal cortex subnetwork of the default mode network and increased FC in the medial temporal lobe subnetwork, regardless of diagnosis. These effects were not seen with nadolol suggesting that the alterations in FC following propranolol administration were not exclusively due to peripheral cardiovascular effects. Thus, beta-adrenergic antagonism can up- or down- regulate FC, depending on the network, and alter coordinated functional activation in the brain. These changes in information processing, as demonstrated by FC, may mediate some of the clinical and behavioral effects of beta-adrenergic antagonism previously reported in patients with ASD. © 2016, Springer Science+Business Media New York.},\n",

The existing specialized already saturated devices (for rare diseases, rare handicaps, autism) not being able to assure them, existing institutions were endowed with additional ways to answer these emergencies. In Nîmes (France), a team of Medical Educational Institute (MEI) welcomed, from 2013 to 2015, 12 “Critical situations”. The families’ disturbances intensity imposed creation of a new device: the transitional unity. First, we describe all the peculiarities of social isolation impacts and the need of care for families and children: their confinements at home, the stopping of the educational project, the installation of negative parental representations on the child, couples who isolated themselves socially, and sibling great difficulties. For the disabled child, preexisting disabilities got more complicated or deteriorated. With family adaptation came along relational handicaps (tyrannical/powerful child, attachment disorders: insecure, avoiding or ambivalent). It is difficult to discriminate what returned to the appropriate child disorder, or to the lack of care, expressed with the effects of family adaptations. We explain then the necessity of developing a specific device to restore parents confidence in the system of care and accompany this confined child: 1 – not to neglect course of parents and child during all this period, to collect it, to understand and to recognize the efforts of parent's adaptation, to estimate their capacity to get loose from it; 2 – to individualize the child welcoming, to sequence his activities, resting on the experiment of the parents and on what he can bear of a new frame; 3 – to accompany the child home and modify interactions between him and his family. This device implies an individual frame for the child and a personalized support by the teams until he can benefit from the more classic care in the MEI group. © 2017},\n",

      "abstract={The existence of abnormal connectivity patterns between resting state networks in neuropsychiatric disorders, including Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD), has been well established. Traditional treatment methods in ASD are limited, and do not address the aberrant network structure. Using real-time fMRI neurofeedback, we directly trained three brain nodes in participants with ASD, in which the aberrant connectivity has been shown to correlate with symptom severity. Desired network connectivity patterns were reinforced in real-time, without participants’ awareness of the training taking place. This training regimen produced large, significant long-term changes in correlations at the network level, and whole brain analysis revealed that the greatest changes were focused on the areas being trained. These changes were not found in the control group. Moreover, changes in ASD resting state connectivity following the training were correlated to changes in behavior, suggesting that neurofeedback can be used to directly alter complex, clinically relevant network connectivity patterns. © 2017, eLife Sciences Publications Ltd.

      "abstract={Background Comorbid executive dysfunction in autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a barrier to adaptive functioning, despite remittance of core social-communication symptoms. Network models of ASD address core symptoms but not comorbid executive dysfunction. Following recent demonstrations in healthy adults that, with increasing executive demands, hubs embedded within frontoparietal-insular control networks interact with a more diverse set of networks, we hypothesized that the capability of hubs to do so is perturbed in ASD and predicts executive behavior. Methods Seventy-five 7- to 13-year-old children with ASD (n = 35) and age- and IQ-matched typically developing control subjects (n = 40) completed both a resting-state and a selective attention task functional magnetic resonance imaging session. We assessed changes in the participation coefficient, a graph theory metric indexing hubness, of 264 brain regions comprising 12 functional networks between the two sessions. Parent reported executive impairment in everyday life was measured using the Behavior Rating Inventory of Executive Function. Results The participation coefficient of the frontoparietal-insular cortex, including core nodes of the frontoparietal control and salience networks, significantly increased in typically developing children but not in children with ASD during the task relative to rest. Change in frontoparietal-insular participation coefficient predicted Behavior Rating Inventory of Executive Function scores indexing the ability to attend to task-oriented output, plan and organize, and sustain working memory. Conclusions Our results suggest that executive impairments in ASD emerge from a failure of frontoparietal-insular control regions to function as adaptive and integrative hubs in the brain's functional network architecture. Our results also demonstrate the utility of examining dynamic network function for elucidating potential biomarkers for disorders with comorbid executive dysfunction. © 2017 Society of Biological Psychiatry},\n",

      "abstract={Background Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is associated with deficits in adaptively orienting attention to behaviorally relevant information. Neural oscillatory activity plays a key role in brain function and provides a high-resolution temporal marker of attention dynamics. Alpha-band (8–12 Hz) activity is associated with both selecting task-relevant stimuli and filtering task-irrelevant information. Methods The present study used electroencephalography to examine alpha-band oscillatory activity associated with attentional capture in 19 children with ASD and 21 age- and IQ-matched typically developing children. Participants completed a rapid serial visual presentation paradigm designed to investigate responses to behaviorally relevant targets and contingent attention capture by task-irrelevant distractors, which either did or did not share a behaviorally relevant feature. Participants also completed 6 minutes of eyes-open resting electroencephalography. Results In contrast to their typically developing peers, children with ASD did not evidence posterior alpha desynchronization to behaviorally relevant targets. Additionally, reduced target-related desynchronization and poorer target detection were associated with increased ASD symptomatology. Typically developing children also showed behavioral and electrophysiological evidence of contingent attention capture, whereas children with ASD showed no behavioral facilitation or alpha desynchronization to distractors that shared a task-relevant feature. Lastly, children with ASD had significantly decreased resting alpha power, and for all participants increased resting alpha levels were associated with greater task-related alpha desynchronization. Conclusions These results suggest that in ASD underresponsivity and impairments in orienting to salient events within their environment are reflected by atypical electroencephalography oscillatory neurodynamics, which may signify atypical arousal levels and/or an excitatory/inhibitory imbalance. © 2017 Society of Biological Psychiatry},\n",

      "abstract={Background Prescription of psychotropic medications is common in autism spectrum disorders (ASDs), either off-label or to treat comorbid conditions such as attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder or depression. Psychotropic medications are intended to alter brain function, yet studies investigating functional brain organization in ASDs rarely take medication usage into account. This could explain some of the inconsistent findings of atypical brain network connectivity reported in the autism literature. Methods The current study tested whether functional connectivity patterns, as assessed with functional magnetic resonance imaging, differed in a cohort of 49 children and adolescents with ASDs based on psychotropic medication status and compared with 50 matched typically developing (TD) participants. Twenty-five participants in the ASD group (51%) reported current psychotropic medication usage, including stimulants, antidepressants, antipsychotics, and anxiolytics. Age, IQ, head motion, and ASD symptom severity did not differ between the groups. Whole-brain functional connectivity between 132 regions of interest was assessed. Results Different functional connectivity patterns were identified in the ASD group taking psychotropic medications (ASD-on) compared with the TD group and the ASD subgroup not using psychotropic medications (ASD-none). The ASD-on group showed distinct underconnectivity between the cerebellum and basal ganglia but corticocortical overconnectivity compared to the TD group. Cortical underconnectivity relative to the TD pattern, on the other hand, was pronounced in the ASD-none group. Conclusions These results suggest that psychotropic medications may affect functional connectivity and that medication status should be taken into consideration when studying brain function in ASDs. © 2017 Society of Biological Psychiatry.},\n",

      "abstract={The whole-brain functional connectivity (FC) pattern obtained from resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging data are commonly applied to study neuropsychiatric conditions such as autism spectrum disorder (ASD) by using different machine learning models. Recent studies indicate that both hyper- and hypoaberrant ASD-associated FCs were widely distributed throughout the entire brain rather than only in some specific brain regions. Deep neural networks (DNN) with multiple hidden layers have shown the ability to systematically extract lower-to-higher level information from high dimensional data across a series of neural hidden layers, significantly improving classification accuracy for such data. In this study, a DNN with a novel feature selection method (DNN-FS) is developed for the high dimensional whole-brain resting-state FC pattern classification of ASD patients vs. typical development (TD) controls. The feature selection method is able to help the DNN generate low dimensional high-quality representations of the whole-brain FC patterns by selecting features with high discriminating power from multiple trained sparse auto-encoders. For the comparison, a DNN without the feature selection method (DNN-woFS) is developed, and both of them are tested with different architectures (i.e., with different numbers of hidden layers/nodes). Results show that the best classification accuracy of 86.36% is generated by the DNN-FS approach with 3 hidden layers and 150 hidden nodes (3/150). Remarkably, DNN-FS outperforms DNN-woFS for all architectures studied. The most significant accuracy improvement was 9.09% with the 3/150 architecture. The method also outperforms other feature selection methods, e.g., two sample t-test and elastic net. In addition to improving the classification accuracy, a Fisher's score-based biomarker identification method based on the DNN is also developed, and used to identify 32 FCs related to ASD. These FCs come from or cross different pre-defined brain networks including the default-mode, cingulo-opercular, frontal-parietal, and cerebellum. Thirteen of them are statically significant between ASD and TD groups (two sample t-test p < 0.05) while 19 of themare not. The relationship between the statically significant FCs and the corresponding ASD behavior symptoms is discussed based on the literature and clinician's expert knowledge. Meanwhile, the potential reason of obtaining 19 FCs which are not statistically significant is also provided. © 2017 Guo, Dominick, Minai, Li, Erickson and Lu.},\n",

      "abstract={Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) has been widely recognized as a complex neurodevelopmental disorder. A large number of neuroimaging studies suggest abnormalities in brain structure and function of patients with ASD, but there is still no consistent conclusion. We sought to investigate both of the structural and functional brain changes in 3-7-year-old children with ASD compared with typically developing controls (TDs), and to assess whether these alterations are associated with autistic behavioral symptoms. Firstly, we applied an optimized method of voxel-based morphometry (VBM) analysis on structural magnetic resonance imaging (sMRI) data to assess the differences of gray matter volume (GMV) between 31 autistic boys aged 3-7 and 31 age- and handness-matched male TDs. Secondly, we used clusters with between-group differences as seed regions to generate intrinsic functional connectivity maps based on resting-state functional connectivity magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fcMRI) in order to evaluate the functional impairments induced by structural alterations. Brain-behavior correlations were assessed among GMV, functional connectivity and symptom severity in children with ASD. VBM analyses revealed increased GMV in left superior temporal gyrus (STG) and left postcentral gyrus (PCG) in ASD children, comparing with TDs. Using left PCG as a seed region, ASD children displayed significantly higher positive connectivity with right angular gyrus (AG) and greater negative connectivity with right superior parietal gyrus (SPG) and right superior occipital gyrus (SOG), which were associated with the severity of symptoms in social interaction, communication and self-care ability. We suggest that stronger functional connectivity between left PCG and right AG, SPG, and SOG detected in young boys with ASD may serve as important indicators of disease severity. Our study provided preliminary functional evidence that may underlie impaired higher-order multisensory integration in ASD children. © 2017 Wang, Fu, Chen, Duan, Guo, Chen, Wu, Xia, Wu and Chen.},\n",

      "abstract={Background: While autism and attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) are considered distinct conditions from a diagnostic perspective, clinically they share some phenotypic features and have high comorbidity. Regardless, most studies have focused on only one condition, with considerable heterogeneity in their results. Taking a dual-condition approach might help elucidate shared and distinct neural characteristics. Method: Graph theory was used to analyse topological properties of structural covariance networks across both conditions and relative to a neurotypical (NT; n = 87) group using data from the ABIDE (autism; n = 62) and ADHD-200 datasets (ADHD; n = 69). Regional cortical thickness was used to construct the structural covariance networks. This was analysed in a theoretical framework examining potential differences in long and short-range connectivity, with a specific focus on relation between central graph measures and cortical thickness. Results: We found convergence between autism and ADHD, where both conditions show an overall decrease in CT covariance with increased Euclidean distance between centroids compared with a NT population. The 2 conditions also show divergence. Namely, there is less modular overlap between the 2 conditions than there is between each condition and the NT group. The ADHD group also showed reduced cortical thickness and lower degree in hub regions than the autism group. Lastly, the ADHD group also showed reduced wiring costs compared with the autism groups. Conclusions: Our results indicate a need for taking an integrated approach when considering highly comorbid conditions such as autism and ADHD. Furthermore, autism and ADHD both showed alterations in the relation between inter-regional covariance and centroid distance, where both groups show a steeper decline in covariance as a function of distance. The 2 groups also diverge on modular organization, cortical thickness of hub regions and wiring cost of the covariance network. Thus, on some network features the groups are distinct, yet on others there is convergence. © The Author 2016. Published by Oxford University Press. All rights reserved.},\n",

      "abstract={The structural organization of the brain can be characterized as a hierarchical ensemble of segregated modules linked by densely interconnected hub regions that facilitate distributed functional interactions. Disturbances to this network may be an important marker of abnormal development. Recently, several neurodevelopmental disorders, including autism spectrum disorder (ASD), have been framed as disorders of connectivity but the full nature and timing of these disturbances remain unclear. In this study, we use non-negative matrix factorization, a data-driven, multivariate approach, to model the structural network architecture of the brain as a set of superposed subnetworks, or network components. In an openly available dataset of 196 subjects scanned between 5 and 85 years we identify a set of robust and reliable subnetworks that develop in tandem with age and reflect both anatomically local and long-range, network hub connections. In a second experiment, we compare network components in a cohort of 51 high-functioning ASD adolescents to a group of age-matched controls. We identify a specific subnetwork representing an increase in local connection strength in the cingulate cortex in ASD (t = 3.44, P < 0.001). This work highlights possible long-term implications of alterations to the developmental trajectories of specific cortical subnetworks.

      "abstract={The social communication impairments defining autism spectrum disorders (ASD) may be built upon core deficits in perspective-taking, language processing, and self-other representation. Self-referential processing entails the ability to incorporate self-awareness, self-judgment, and self-memory in information processing. Very few studies have examined the neural bases of integrating self-other representation and semantic processing in individuals with ASD. The main objective of this functional MRI study is to examine the role of language and social brain networks in self-other processing in young adults with ASD. Nineteen high-functioning male adults with ASD and 19 age-sex-and-IQ-matched typically developing (TD) control participants made “yes” or “no” judgments of whether an adjective, presented visually, described them (self) or their favorite teacher (other). Both ASD and TD participants showed significantly increased activity in the medial prefrontal cortex (MPFC) during self and other processing relative to letter search. Analyses of group differences revealed significantly reduced activity in left inferior frontal gyrus (LIFG), and left inferior parietal lobule (LIPL) in ASD participants, relative to TD controls. ASD participants also showed significantly weaker functional connectivity of the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) with several brain areas while processing self-related words. The LIFG and IPL are important regions functionally at the intersection of language and social roles; reduced recruitment of these regions in ASD participants may suggest poor level of semantic and social processing. In addition, poor connectivity of the ACC may suggest the difficulty in meeting the linguistic and social demands of this task in ASD. Overall, this study provides new evidence of the altered recruitment of the neural networks underlying language and social cognition in ASD. © 2017},\n",

      "abstract={Background: There is a lack of agreement about functional connectivity differences in individuals with autism spectrum disorder (ASD). Studies using absolute strength have found reduced connectivity, while those using relative strength - a measure of system topology - reveal mostly enhanced connectivity. We hypothesized that mixed findings may be driven by the metric of functional connectivity. Methods: Resting-state echo planar 3 T functional magnetic resonance imaging scans were acquired on a Siemens Verio Scanner from 6 to 17-year-old youth with ASD (n = 81) and a matched typically developing control group (n = 82). All functional time series data were preprocessed using a confound regression procedure that has been previously validated in large-scale developmental datasets. It has also been shown to be highly effective at reducing the influence of motion artifact on connectivity data. We extracted time series data from a 333-node parcellation scheme, which was previously mapped to 13 functional systems. A Pearson's correlation was calculated and transformed to Fisher's z between every pair of nodes to create a weighted 333 × 333 adjacency matrix. Mean absolute functional connectivity strength was the mean Fisher's z of the matrix. Relative functional connectivity was corrected for individual differences in mean absolute functional connectivity (i.e., each connection in the matrix was divided by their mean z), and functional connectivity was evaluated within and across each of the functional networks in the parcellation scheme. Results: Absolute functional connectivity strength was lower in ASD, and lower functional connectivity was correlated with greater ASD symptom severity. Relative functional connectivity was higher for the ASD group in the ventral attention and retrosplenial-temporal systems, with lower cross-system functional connectivity between the ventral attention and somatomotor-mouth systems. Functional connectivity within the ventral attention and retro-splenial systems correlated significantly with ASD symptom severity. Conclusions: Within a context of globally weaker functional connectivity, youth with ASD have an atypical topology of brain systems that support social perception and communication. This study clarifies the mixed results reported previously and demonstrates that the functional connectivity metric influences the observed direction of functional connectivity differences for individuals with ASD. © 2017 The Author(s).},\n",

      "abstract={Theoretically, autism should be underpinned by aberrant brain dynamics. However, how brain activity changes over time in individuals with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) remains unknown. Here we characterize brain dynamics in autism using an energy-landscape analysis applied to resting-state fMRI data. Whereas neurotypical brain activity frequently transits between two major brain states via an intermediate state, high-functioning adults with ASD show fewer neural transitions due to an unstable intermediate state, and these infrequent transitions predict the severity of autism. Moreover, in contrast to the controls whose IQ is correlated with the neural transition frequency, IQ scores of individuals with ASD are instead predicted by the stability of their brain dynamics. Finally, such brain-behaviour associations are related to functional segregation between brain networks. These findings suggest that atypical functional coordination in the brains of adults with ASD underpins overly stable neural dynamics, which supports both their ASD symptoms and cognitive abilities.},\n",

      "abstract={Background: The autism and schizophrenia spectra overlap to a large degree in the social and interpersonal domains. Similarly, abnormal excitatory glutamate and inhibitory γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA) neurotransmitter concentrations have been reported for both spectra, with the interplay of these neurotransmitters important for cortical excitation to inhibition regulation. This study investigates whether these neurotransmitter abnormalities are specific to the shared symptomatology, and whether the degree of abnormality increases with increasing symptom severity. Hence, the relationship between the glutamate/GABA ratio and autism and schizophrenia spectrum traits in an unmedicated, subclinical population was investigated. Methods: A total of 37 adults (19 female, 18 male) aged 18-38 years completed the Autism Spectrum Quotient (AQ) and Schizotypal Personality Questionnaire (SPQ), and participated in the resting state proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy study in which sequences specific for quantification of glutamate and GABA+ concentration were applied to a right and left superior temporal voxel. Results: There were significant, moderate, positive relationships between right superior temporal glutamate/GABA+ ratio and AQ, SPQ and AQ+SPQ total scores (p<0.05), SPQ subscales Social Anxiety, No Close Friend, Constricted Affect, Odd Behaviour, Odd Speech, Ideas of Reference and Suspiciousness, and AQ subscales Social Skills, Communication and Attention Switching (p<0.05); increased glutamate/GABA+ coinciding with higher scores on these subscales. Only the relationships between glutamate/GABA+ ratio and Social Anxiety, Constricted Affect, Social Skills and Communication survived multiple comparison correction (p< 0.004). Left superior temporal glutamate/GABA+ ratio reduced with increasing restricted imagination (p<0.05). Conclusion: These findings demonstrate evidence for an association between excitatory/inhibitory neurotransmitter concentrations and symptoms that are shared between the autism and schizophrenia spectra. © 2017 Ford et al.

Here, using fMRI, we demonstrate that adding a fixation cross in the eye region of dynamic facial emotional stimuli significantly increases activation in the social brain of healthy, neurotypical participants when compared with activation for the exact same stimuli observed in a free-viewing mode. In addition, using PPI analysis, we show that the degree of amygdala connectivity with the rest of the brain is enhanced for the constrained view for all emotions tested except for fear, and that anxiety and alexithymia modulate the strength of amygdala connectivity for each emotion differently. Finally, we show that autistic traits have opposite effects on amygdala connectivity for fearful and angry emotional expressions, suggesting that these emotions should be treated separately in studies investigating facial emotion processing. © The Author (2017).

      "abstract={Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by social deficits and repetitive behaviors that typically emerge by 24 months of age. To develop effective early interventions that can potentially ameliorate the defining deficits of ASD and improve long-Term outcomes, early detection is essential. Using prospective neuroimaging of 59 6-month-old infants with a high familial risk for ASD, we show that functional connectivity magnetic resonance imaging correctly identified which individual children would receive a research clinical best-estimate diagnosis of ASD at 24months of age. Functional brain connections were defined in 6-month-old infants that correlated with 24-month scores on measures of social behavior, language, motor development, and repetitive behavior, which are all features common to the diagnosis of ASD. A fully cross-validated machine learning algorithm applied at age 6 months had a positive predictive value of 100% [95% confidence interval (CI), 62.9 to 100], correctly predicting 9 of 11 infants who received a diagnosis of ASD at 24 months (sensitivity, 81.8%; 95% CI, 47.8 to 96.8). All 48 6-month-old infants who were not diagnosed with ASD were correctly classified [specificity, 100% (95% CI, 90.8 to 100); negative predictive value, 96.0% (95% CI, 85.1 to 99.3)]. These findings have clinical implications for early risk assessment and the feasibility of developing early preventative interventions for ASD. © 2017, The Authors, some rights reserved; exclusive licensee American Association for the Advancement of Science.},\n",

      "abstract={Background: The approximate 5:1 male to female ratio in clinical detection of Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) prevents research from characterizing the female phenotype. Current open access repositories [such as those in the Autism Brain Imaging Data Exchange (ABIDE I-II)] contain large numbers of females to help begin providing a new characterization of females on the autistic spectrum. Here we introduce new methods to integrate data in a scale-free manner from continuous biophysical rhythms of the nervous systems and discrete (ordinal) observational scores. Methods: New data-types derived from image-based involuntary head motions and personalized statistical platform were combined with a data-driven approach to unveil sub-groups within the female cohort. Further, to help refine the clinical DSM-based ASD vs. Asperger’s Syndrome (AS) criteria, distributional analyses of ordinal score data from Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule (ADOS)-based criteria were used on both the female and male phenotypes. Results: Separate clusters were automatically uncovered in the female cohort corresponding to differential levels of severity. Specifically, the AS-subgroup emerged as the most severely affected with an excess level of noise and randomness in the involuntary head micro-movements. Extending the methods to characterize males of ABIDE revealed ASD-males to be more affected than AS-males. A thorough study of ADOS-2 and ADOS-G scores provided confounding results regarding the ASD vs. AS male comparison, whereby the ADOS-2 rendered the AS-phenotype worse off than the ASD-phenotype, while ADOS-G flipped the results. Females with AS scored higher on severity than ASD-females in all ADOS test versions and their scores provided evidence for significantly higher severity than males. However, the statistical landscapes underlying female and male scores appeared disparate. As such, further interpretation of the ADOS data seems problematic, rather suggesting the critical need to develop an entirely new metric to measure social behavior in females. Conclusions: According to the outcome of objective, data-driven analyses and subjective clinical observation, these results support the proposition that the female phenotype is different. Consequently the “social behavioral male ruler” will continue to mask the female autistic phenotype. It is our proposition that new observational behavioral tests ought to contain normative scales, be statistically sound and combined with objective data-driven approaches to better characterize the females across the human lifespan. © 2017 Torres, Mistry, Caballero and Whyatt.},\n",

This fMRI study examined activation and synchronization of the brain's reading network in children with ASD with specific reading comprehension deficits during a word similarities task. Thirteen typically developing children and 18 children with ASD performed the task in the MRI scanner. No statistically significant group differences in functional activation were observed; however, children with ASD showed decreased functional connectivity between the left inferior frontal gyrus (LIFG) and the left inferior occipital gyrus (LIOG). In addition, reading comprehension ability significantly positively predicted functional connectivity between the LIFG and left thalamus (LTHAL) among all subjects.

      "abstract={Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is exceptionally heterogeneous in both clinical and physiopathological presentations. Clinical variability applies to ASD-specific symptoms and frequent comorbid psychopathology such as emotional lability (EL). To date, the physiopathological underpinnings of the co-occurrence of EL and ASD are unknown. As a first step, we examined within-ASD inter-individual variability of EL and its neuronal correlates using resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (R-fMRI). We analyzed R-fMRI data from 58 children diagnosed with ASD (5-12 years) in relation to the Conners' Parent Rating Scale EL index. We performed both an a priori amygdala region-of-interest (ROI) analysis, and a multivariate unbiased whole-brain data-driven approach. While no significant brain-behavior relationships were identified regarding amygdala intrinsic functional connectivity (iFC), multivariate whole-brain analyses revealed an extended functional circuitry centered on two regions: Middle frontal gyrus (MFG) and posterior insula (PI). Follow-up parametric and nonparametric ROI-analyses of these regions revealed relationships between EL and MFG- A nd PI-iFC with default, salience, and visual networks suggesting that higher-order cognitive and somatosensory processes are critical for emotion regulation in ASD. We did not detect evidence of amygdala iFC underpinning EL in ASD. However, exploratory whole-brain analyses identified large-scale networks that have been previously reported abnormal in ASD. Future studies should consider EL as a potential source of neuronal heterogeneity in ASD and focus on multinetwork interactions. © 2017, Mary Ann Liebert, Inc.},\n",

      "abstract={Currently, there are no effective pharmacologic treatments for the core symptoms of autism spectrum disorder (ASD). There is, nevertheless, potential for progress. For example, recent evidence suggests that the excitatory (E) glutamate and inhibitory (I) GABA systems may be altered in ASD. However, no prior studies of ASD have examined the 'responsivity' of the E-I system to pharmacologic challenge; or whether E-I modulation alters abnormalities in functional connectivity of brain regions implicated in the disorder. Therefore, we used magnetic resonance spectroscopy ([1H]MRS) to measure prefrontal E-I flux in response to the glutamate and GABA acting drug riluzole in adult men with and without ASD. We compared the change in prefrontal 'Inhibitory Index'-the GABA fraction within the pool of glutamate plus GABA metabolites-post riluzole challenge; and the impact of riluzole on differences in resting-state functional connectivity. Despite no baseline differences in E-I balance, there was a significant group difference in response to pharmacologic challenge. Riluzole increased the prefrontal cortex inhibitory index in ASD but decreased it in controls. There was also a significant group difference in prefrontal functional connectivity at baseline, which was abolished by riluzole within the ASD group. Our results also show, for we believe the first time in ASD, that E-I flux can be 'shifted' with a pharmacologic challenge, but that responsivity is significantly different from controls. Further, our initial evidence suggests that abnormalities in functional connectivity can be 'normalised' by targeting E-I, even in adults.},\n",

      "abstract={Graph theoretical analysis has become an important tool in the examination of brain dysconnectivity in neurological and psychiatric brain disorders. A common analysis step in the construction of the functional graph or network involves “thresholding” of the connectivity matrix, selecting the set of edges that together form the graph on which network organization is evaluated. To avoid systematic differences in absolute number of edges, studies have argued against the use of an “absolute threshold” in case-control studies and have proposed the use of “proportional thresholding” instead, in which a pre-defined number of strongest connections are selected as network edges, ensuring equal network density across datasets. Here, we systematically studied the effect of proportional thresholding on the construction of functional matrices and subsequent graph analysis in patient-control functional connectome studies. In a few simple experiments we show that differences in overall strength of functional connectivity (FC) – as often observed between patients and controls – can have predictable consequences for between-group differences in network organization. In individual networks with lower overall FC the proportional thresholding algorithm has to select more edges based on lower correlations, which have (on average) a higher probability of being spurious, and thus introduces a higher degree of randomness in the resulting network. We show across both empirical and artificial patient-control datasets that lower levels of overall FC in either the patient or control group will most often lead to differences in network efficiency and clustering, suggesting that differences in FC across subjects will be artificially inflated or translated into differences in network organization. Based on the presented case-control findings we inform about the caveats of proportional thresholding in patient-control studies in which groups show a between-group difference in overall FC. We make recommendations on how to examine, report and to take into account overall FC effects in future patient-control functional connectome studies. © 2017 The Authors},\n",

      "abstract={Functional connectivity studies play a huge role in understanding the relationship between the network connections and the behavioral phenotype of patients with pervasive developmental disorders (PDD). Some patients with PDD may not be able to tolerate the imaging procedure while they are awake, and, hence, they often need general anesthesia. General anesthesia is a confounding factor in functional imaging studies due to its effect on the functional connectivity. The objective of this study is to look at the resting-state functional connectivity (RS-FC) under sevoflurane anesthesia in patients with PDDs. Thirteen adults with PDD scheduled for magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain under general anesthesia were recruited for the study. Resting-state functional MRI (fMRI) scans were acquired at 1 minimum alveolar concentration (MAC) of sevoflurane. Spontaneous blood oxygenation level-dependent fluctuations were measured, and a seed-voxel analysis was done to identify the resting-state networks. Subjects' data were compared with data from 16 nonanesthetized healthy controls. Six networks (default mode network [DMN], executive control network [ECN], salience network [SN], auditory, visual, and sensorimotor) were investigated. At 1 MAC sevoflurane anesthesia, RS-FC was preserved in all the networks. Secondary analysis of connectivity showed a decrease in connectivity within the thalamus and an increase in DMN-ECN and DMN-SN cross-network connectivity in the anesthetized patient group compared to healthy controls. Previous reports suggested that even mild levels of anesthesia could reduce overall fluctuation levels in the major brain. However, our results provide strong evidence that most networks can sustain detectable levels of activity in patients with PDDs even under deep levels of anesthesia. © Copyright 2017, Mary Ann Liebert, Inc. 2017.},\n",

      "abstract={Background Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and schizophrenia are neurodevelopmental conditions that are characterized by significant social impairment. Emerging genomic and neurobiological evidence has increasingly pointed to shared pathophysiologic mechanisms in the two disorders. Overlap in social impairment may reflect similar underlying neural dysfunction in social-cognitive brain networks, yet few studies have directly compared brain function and communication between those with ASD and schizophrenia. Methods Outpatients with schizophrenia (n = 36), ASD (n = 33), and healthy volunteers (n = 37) completed a visual perspective-taking task during functional neuroimaging at 3T to assess similarities and differences in fronto-temporal brain function and connectivity during social-cognitive processing. Analyses employed general linear models to examine differences in amplitude of BOLD-signal response between disorder groups, and computed functional connectivity coefficients to investigate differences in the connectivity profiles of networks implicated in social cognition. Results Despite similar behavioral impairments, participants with ASD and schizophrenia evidenced distinct neural abnormalities during perspective-taking. Functional activation results indicated reduced temporo-parietal junction and medial prefrontal activity in ASD compared to schizophrenia (all Puncor &lt; 0.002). Functional connectivity analyses further revealed significantly greater local orbitofrontal connectivity in ASD than schizophrenia (all PFDR &lt; 0.028) during perspective-taking. Differences in brain activation and connectivity were unrelated to antipsychotic medication dose. Conclusions Autism and schizophrenia are characterized by similar social-cognitive impairments that may stem from different underlying abnormalities in the functional organization and communication of the social brain. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.},\n",

      "abstract={Recent evidence for abnormal thalamic connectivity in autism spectrum disorders (ASD) and sensory processing disorders suggests the thalamus may play a role in sensory over-responsivity (SOR), an extreme negative response to sensory stimuli, which is common in ASD. However, there is yet little understanding of changes in thalamic connectivity during exposure to aversive sensory inputs in individuals with ASD. In particular, the pulvinar nucleus of the thalamus is implicated in atypical sensory processing given its role in selective attention, regulation, and sensory integration. This study aimed to examine the role of pulvinar connectivity in ASD during mildly aversive sensory input. Functional magnetic resonance imaging was used to examine connectivity with the pulvinar during exposure to mildly aversive auditory and tactile stimuli in 38 youth (age 9–17; 19 ASD, 19 IQ-matched typically developing (TD)). Parents rated children's SOR severity on two standard scales. Compared to TD, ASD participants displayed aberrant modulation of connectivity between pulvinar and cortex (including sensory-motor and prefrontal regions) during sensory stimulation. In ASD participants, pulvinar-amygdala connectivity was correlated with severity of SOR symptoms. Deficits in modulation of thalamocortical connectivity in youth with ASD may reflect reduced thalamo-cortical inhibition in response to sensory stimulation, which could lead to difficulty filtering out and/or integrating sensory information. An increase in amygdala connectivity with the pulvinar might be partially responsible for deficits in selective attention as the amygdala signals the brain to attend to distracting sensory stimuli.

      "abstract={The global functional brain network (graph) is more suitable for characterizing brain states than local analysis of the connectivity of brain regions. Therefore, graph-theoretic approaches are natural methods to use for studying the brain. However, conventional graph theoretical analyses are limited due to the lack of formal statistical methods of estimation and inference. For example, the concept of correlation between two vectors of graphs has not yet been defined. Thus, the introduction of a notion of correlation between graphs becomes necessary to better understand how brain sub-networks interact. To develop a framework to infer correlation between graphs, one may assume that they are generated by models and that the parameters of the models are the random variables. Then, it is possible to define that two graphs are independent when the random variables representing their parameters are independent. In the real world, however, the model is rarely known, and consequently, the parameters cannot be estimated. By analyzing the graph spectrum, it is shown that the spectral radius is highly associated with the parameters of the graph model. Based on this, a framework for correlation inference between graphs is constructed and the approach illustrated on functional magnetic resonance imaging data on 814 subjects comprising 529 controls and 285 individuals diagnosed with autism spectrum disorder (ASD). Results show that correlations between the default-mode and control, default-mode and somatomotor, and default-mode and visual sub-networks are higher in individuals with ASD than in the controls. ï¿½ 2016 Elsevier B.V.},\n",

      "abstract={Among the most co-occurring conditions in autism spectrum disorders (ASD), there are sleep disorders which may exacerbate associated behavioral disorders and lead to intensification of existing autistic symptoms. Several studies investigating the use of melatonin in the treatment of sleep disorders in ASD have shown comparative efficiency in sleep with little or no side effects. Here we report a case of ASD with non-24-hour rhythm and the effect of melatonin in circadian parameters by actigraphy. Visual analysis of the first 10 days recorded and the periodogram suggest that this patient showed a non-24-hour rhythm. This ASD subject showed before melatonin administration an activity/rest rhythm lower than 24 hours. The results show that melatonin increased approximately 4.7 times the regularity of circadian activity rhythm and resting staying on average between 00:00 and 06:00 and showed positive effects in improving the quality of sleep and behavior. So, the actigraphy showed an ASD subject with a non-24-hour activity/rest rhythm which changed this rhythm to a 24-hour rhythm after melatonin administration. This result reinforces the prospect of therapy with melatonin for synchronization (increased regularity) of endogenous rhythms and improve sleep quality and hence behavior and indicates the actigraphy as a choice tool to characterize several parameters of the activity/rest rhythm of ASD individuals. © 2017 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.},\n",

      "abstract={Autism spectrum disorders (ASDs) are known to be characterized by restricted and repetitive behaviors and interests and by impairments in social communication and interactions mainly including “theory of mind” (ToM) processes. The cerebellum has emerged as one of the brain regions affected by ASDs. As the cerebellum is known to influence cerebral cortex activity via cerebello-thalamo-cortical (CTC) circuits, it has been proposed that cerebello-cortical “disconnection” could in part underlie autistic symptoms. We used resting-state (RS) functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to investigate the potential RS connectivity changes between the cerebellar dentate nucleus (DN) and the CTC circuit targets, that may contribute to ASD pathophysiology. When comparing ASD patients to controls, we found decreased connectivity between the left DN and cerebral regions known to be components of the ToM network and the default mode network, implicated in specific aspects of mentalizing, social cognition processing, and higher order emotional processes. Further, a pattern of overconnectivity was also detected between the left DN and the supramodal cerebellar lobules associated with the default mode network. The presented RS-fMRI data provide evidence that functional connectivity (FC) between the dentate nucleus and the cerebral cortex is altered in ASD patients. This suggests that the dysfunction reported within the cerebral cortical network, typically related to social features of ASDs, may be at least partially related to an impaired interaction between cerebellum and key cortical social brain regions. © 2016, Springer Science+Business Media New York.},\n",

      "abstract={Exploring resting-state brain functional connectivity of autism spectrum disorders (ASD) using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data has become a popular topic over the past few years. The data in a standard brain template consist of over 170,000 voxel specific points in time for each human subject. Such an ultra-high dimensionality makes the voxel-level functional connectivity analysis (involving four billion voxel pairs) both statistically and computationally inefficient. In this work, we introduce a new framework to identify the functional brain network at the anatomical region level for each individual. We propose two pairwise tests to detect region dependence, and one multiple testing procedure to identify global structures of the network. The limiting null distribution of each test statistic is derived. It is also shown that the tests are rate optimal when the alternative block networks are sparse. The numerical studies show that the proposed tests are valid and powerful. We apply our method to a resting-state fMRI study on autism and identify patient-unique and control-unique hub regions. These findings are biologically meaningful and consistent with the existing literature. © 2017 Elsevier Inc.},\n",

      "abstract={Dysfunction of brain-derived arginine-vasopressin (AVP) systems may be involved in the etiology of autism spectrum disorder (ASD). Certain regions such as the hypothalamus, amygdala, and hippocampus are known to contain either AVP neurons or terminals and may play an important role in regulating complex social behaviors. The present study was designed to investigate the concomitant changes in autistic behaviors, circulating AVP levels, and the structure and functional connectivity (FC) of specific brain regions in autistic children compared with typically developing children (TDC) aged from 3 to 5 years. The results showed: (1) children with ASD had a significantly increased volume in the left amygdala and left hippocampus, and a significantly decreased volume in the bilateral hypothalamus compared to TDC, and these were positively correlated with plasma AVP level. (2) Autistic children had a negative FC between the left amygdala and the bilateral supramarginal gyri compared to TDC. The degree of the negative FC between amygdala and supramarginal gyrus was associated with a higher score on the clinical autism behavior checklist. (3) The degree of negative FC between left amygdala and left supramarginal gyrus was associated with a lowering of the circulating AVP concentration in boys with ASD. (4) Autistic children showed a higher FC between left hippocampus and right subcortical area compared to TDC. (5) The circulating AVP was negatively correlated with the visual and listening response score of the childhood autism rating scale. These results strongly suggest that changes in structure and FC in brain regions containing AVP may be involved in the etiology of autism. © 2017, Shanghai Institutes for Biological Sciences, CAS and Springer Science+Business Media Singapore.},\n",

      "abstract={Growing evidence suggests that posterior cerebellar lobe contributes to social perception in healthy adults. However, they know little about how this process varies across age and with development. Using cross-sectional fMRI data, they examined cerebellar response to biological (BIO) versus scrambled (SCRAM) motion within typically developing (TD) and autism spectrum disorder (ASD) samples (age 4–30 years old), characterizing cerebellar response and BIO>SCRAM-selective effective connectivity, as well as associations with age and social ability. TD individuals recruited regions throughout cerebellar posterior lobe during BIO>SCRAM, especially bilateral lobule VI, and demonstrated connectivity with right posterior superior temporal sulcus (RpSTS) in left VI, Crus I/II, and VIIIb. ASD individuals showed BIO>SCRAM activity in left VI and left Crus I/II, and bilateral connectivity with RpSTS in Crus I/II and VIIIb/IX. No between-group differences emerged in well-matched subsamples. Among TD individuals, older age predicted greater BIO>SCRAM response in left VIIb and left VIIIa/b, but reduced connectivity between RpSTS and widespread regions of the right cerebellum. In ASD, older age predicted greater response in left Crus I and bilateral Crus II, but decreased effective connectivity with RpSTS in bilateral Crus I/II. In ASD, increased BIO>SCRAM signal in left VI/Crus I and right Crus II, VIIb, and dentate predicted lower social symptomaticity; increased effective connectivity with RpSTS in right Crus I/II and bilateral VI and I–V predicted greater symptomaticity. These data suggest that posterior cerebellum contributes to the neurodevelopment of social perception in both basic and clinical populations. © 2017 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},\n",

      "abstract={Background. Multi-Scale Ranked Organizing Map coupled with Implicit Function as Squashing Time algorithm(MS-ROM/I-FAST) is a new, complex system based on Artificial Neural networks (ANNs) able to extract features of interest in computerized EEG through the analysis of few minutes of their EEG without any preliminary pre-processing. A proof of concept study previously published showed accuracy values ranging from 94%-98% in discerning subjects with Mild Cognitive Impairment and/or Alzheimer's Disease from healthy elderly people. The presence of deviant patterns in simple resting state EEG recordings in autism, consistent with the atypical organization of the cerebral cortex present, prompted us in applying this potent analytical systems in search of a EEG signature of the disease. Aim of the study. The aim of the study is to assess how effectively this methodology distinguishes subjects with autism from typically developing ones. Methods. Fifteen definite ASD subjects (13 males; 2 females; age range 7–14; mean value = 10.4) and ten typically developing subjects (4 males; 6 females; age range 7–12; mean value 9.2) were included in the study. Patients received Autism diagnoses according to DSM-V criteria, subsequently confirmed by the ADOS scale. A segment of artefact-free EEG lasting 60 seconds was used to compute input values for subsequent analyses. MS-ROM/I-FAST coupled with a well-documented evolutionary system able to select predictive features (TWIST) created an invariant features vector input of EEG on which supervised machine learning systems acted as blind classifiers. Results. The overall predictive capability of machine learning system in sorting out autistic cases from normal control amounted consistently to 100% with all kind of systems employed using training-testing protocol and to 84% - 92.8% using Leave One Out protocol. The similarities among the ANN weight matrixes measured with apposite algorithms were not affected by the age of the subjects. This suggests that the ANNs do not read age-related EEG patterns, but rather invariant features related to the brain's underlying disconnection signature. Conclusion. This pilot study seems to open up new avenues for the development of non-invasive diagnostic testing for the early detection of ASD. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.},\n",

      "abstract={Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is associated with disrupted brain networks. Neuroimaging techniques provide noninvasive methods of investigating abnormal connectivity patterns in ASD. In the present study, we compare functional connectivity networks in people with ASD with those in typical controls, using neuroimaging data from the Autism Brain Imaging Data Exchange (ABIDE) project. Specifically, we focus on the characteristics of intrinsic functional connectivity based on data collected by resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI). Our aim was to identify disrupted brain connectivity patterns across all networks, instead of in individual edges, by using advanced statistical methods. Unlike many brain connectome studies, in which networks are prespecified before the edge connectivity in each network is compared between clinical groups, we detected the latent differentially expressed networks automatically. Our network-level analysis identified abnormal connectome networks that (i) included a high proportion of edges that were differentially expressed between people with ASD and typical controls; and (ii) showed highly-organized graph topology. These findings provide new insight into the study of the underlying neuropsychiatric mechanism of ASD. © 2017 Chen, Xing and Kang.},\n",

ABIDE II includes datasets from an additional 487 individuals with ASD and 557 controls previously collected across 16 international institutions. The combination of ABIDE I and ABIDE II provides investigators with 2156 unique cross-sectional datasets allowing selection of samples for discovery and/or replication. This sample size can also facilitate the identification of neurobiological subgroups, as well as preliminary examinations of sex differences in ASD.

Methods: We collected resting state dense-array electroencephalography data from 21 fragile X syndrome (FXS) patients and 21 age-matched healthy participants. Results: FXS patients exhibited greater gamma frequency band power, which was correlated with social and sensory processing difficulties. Second, FXS patients showed increased spatial spreading of phase-synchronized high frequency neural activity in the gamma band. Third, we observed increased negative theta-to-gamma but decreased alpha-to-gamma band amplitude coupling, and the level of increased theta power was inversely related to the level of resting gamma power in FXS. Conclusions: Increased theta band power and coupling from frontal sources may represent a mechanism providing compensatory inhibition of high-frequency gamma band activity, potentially contributing to the widely varying level of neurophysiological and behavioral abnormalities and treatment response seen in full-mutation FXS patients. These findings extend preclinical observations and provide new mechanistic insights into brain alterations and their variability across FXS patients. Electrophysiological measures may provide useful translational biomarkers for advancing drug development and individualizing treatments for neurodevelopmental disorders with associated neuronal hyperexcitability. © 2017 The Author(s).},\n",

      "abstract={Background: Attentional disorders (ADD) feature decreased attention span, impulsivity, and over-activity interfering with successful lives. Childhood onset ADD frequently persists to adulthood. Etiology may be hereditary or disease associated. Prevalence is 5% but recognition may be 'overshadowed' by comorbidities (brain injury, mood disorder) thereby escaping formal recognition. Blinded diagnosis by MRI has failed. ADD may not itself manifest a single anatomical pattern of brain abnormality but may reflect multiple, unique responses to numerous and diverse etiologies. Alternatively, a stable ADD-specific brain pattern may be better detected by brain physiology. EEG coherence, measuring cortical connectivity, is used to explore this possibility. Methods: Participants: Ages 2 to 22 years; 347 ADD and 619 neurotypical controls (CON). Following artifact reduction, principal components analysis (PCA) identifies coherence factors with unique loading patterns. Discriminant function analysis (DFA) determines discrimination success differentiating ADD from CON. Split-half and jackknife analyses estimate prospective diagnostic success. Coherence factor loading constitutes an ADD-specific pattern or 'connectome'. Results: PCA identified 40 factors explaining 50% of total variance. DFA on CON versus ADD groups utilizing all factors was highly significant (p≤0.0001). ADD subjects were separated into medication and comorbidity subgroups. DFA (stepping allowed) based on CON versus ADD without comorbidities or medication treatment successfully classified the correspondingly held out ADD subjects in every instance. Ten randomly generated split-half replications of the entire population demonstrated high-average classification success for each of the left out test-sets (overall: CON, 83.65%; ADD, 90.07%). Higher success was obtained with more restricted age sub-samples using jackknifing: 2-8 year olds (CON, 90.0%; ADD, 90.6%); 8-14 year olds (CON, 96.8%; ADD 95.9%); and 14-20 year-olds (CON, 100.0%; ADD, 97.1%). The connectome manifested decreased and increased coherence. Patterns were complex and bi-hemispheric; typically reported front-back and left-right loading patterns were not observed. Subtemporal electrodes (seldom utilized) were prominently involved. Conclusions: Results demonstrate a stable coherence connectome differentiating ADD from CON subjects including subgroups with and without comorbidities and/or medications. This functional 'connectome', constitutes a diagnostic ADD phenotype. Split-half replications support potential for EEG-based ADD diagnosis, with increased accuracy using limited age ranges. Repeated studies could assist recognition of physiological change from interventions (pharmacological, behavioral). © 2017 The Author(s).},\n",

      "abstract={Kleefstra syndrome (KS) (Mendelian Inheritance in Man (MIM) no. 610253), also known as 9q34 deletion syndrome, is an autosomal dominant disorder caused by haploinsufficiency of euchromatic histone methyltransferase-1 (EHMT1). The clinical phenotype of KS includes moderate to severe intellectual disability with absent speech, hypotonia, brachycephaly, congenital heart defects, and dysmorphic facial features with hypertelorism, synophrys, macroglossia, protruding tongue, and prognathism. Only a few cases of de novo missense mutations in EHMT1 giving rise to KS have been described. However, some EHMT1 variants have been described in individuals presenting with autism spectrum disorder or mild intellectual disability, suggesting that the phenotypic spectrum resulting from EHMT1 alterations may be quite broad. In this report, we describe two unrelated patients with complex medical histories consistent with KS in whom next generation sequencing identified the same novel c.2426C>T (p.P809L) missense variant in EHMT1. To examine the functional significance of this novel variant, we performed molecular dynamics simulations of the wild type and p.P809L variant, which predicted that the latter would have a propensity to misfold, leading to abnormal histone mark binding. Recombinant EHMT1 p.P809L was also studied using far UV circular dichroism spectroscopy and intrinsic protein fluorescence. These functional studies confirmed the model-based hypotheses and provided evidence for protein misfolding and aberrant target recognition as the underlying pathogenic mechanism for this novel KS-associated variant. This is the first report to suggest that missense variants in EHMT1 that lead to protein misfolding and disrupted histone mark binding can lead to KS. © 2017 by The American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Inc.},\n",

      "abstract={Over the last decade, structure–function relationships have begun to encompass networks of brain areas rather than individual structures. For example, corticostriatal circuits have been associated with sensorimotor, limbic, and cognitive information processing, and damage to these circuits has been shown to produce unique behavioral outcomes in Autism, Parkinson's Disease, Schizophrenia and healthy ageing. However, it remains an open question how abnormal or absent connectivity can be detected at the individual level. Here, we provide a method for clustering gross morphological structures into subregions with unique functional connectivity fingerprints, and generate network probability maps usable as a baseline to compare individual cases against. We used connectivity metrics derived from resting-state fMRI (N = 100), in conjunction with hierarchical clustering methods, to parcellate the striatum into functionally distinct clusters. We identified three highly reproducible striatal subregions, across both hemispheres and in an independent replication dataset (N = 100) (dice-similarity values 0.40–1.00). Each striatal seed region resulted in a highly reproducible distinct connectivity fingerprint: the putamen showed predominant connectivity with cortical and cerebellar sensorimotor and language processing areas; the ventromedial striatum cluster had a distinct limbic connectivity pattern; the caudate showed predominant connectivity with the thalamus, frontal and occipital areas, and the cerebellum. Our corticostriatal probability maps agree with existing connectivity data in humans and non-human primates, and showed a high degree of replication. We believe that these maps offer an efficient tool to further advance hypothesis driven research and provide important guidance when investigating deviant connectivity in neurological patient populations suffering from e.g., stroke or cerebral palsy.

      "abstract={Background Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a highly heritable neurodevelopmental disorder, yet the search for definite genetic etiologies remains elusive. Delineating ASD endophenotypes can boost the statistical power to identify the genetic etiologies and pathophysiology of ASD. We aimed to test for endophenotypes of neuroanatomy and associated intrinsic functional connectivity (iFC) via contrasting male youth with ASD, their unaffected brothers and typically developing (TD) males. Method The 94 participants (aged 9-19 years)-20 male youth with ASD, 20 unaffected brothers and 54 TD males-received clinical assessments, and undertook structural and resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging scans. Voxel-based morphometry was performed to obtain regional gray and white matter volumes. A seed-based approach, with seeds defined by the regions demonstrating atypical neuroanatomy shared by youth with ASD and unaffected brothers, was implemented to derive iFC. General linear models were used to compare brain structures and iFC among the three groups. Assessment of familiality was investigated by permutation tests for variance of the within-family pair difference. Results We found that atypical gray matter volume in the mid-cingulate cortex was shared between male youth with ASD and their unaffected brothers as compared with TD males. Moreover, reduced iFC between the mid-cingulate cortex and the right inferior frontal gyrus, and increased iFC between the mid-cingulate cortex and bilateral middle occipital gyrus were the shared features of male ASD youth and unaffected brothers. Conclusions Atypical neuroanatomy and iFC surrounding the mid-cingulate cortex may be a potential endophenotypic marker for ASD in males. © 2016 Cambridge University Press.},\n",

      "abstract={Initiating joint attention (IJA), the behavioral instigation of coordinated focus of 2 people on an object, emerges over the first 2 years of life and supports social-communicative functioning related to the healthy development of aspects of language, empathy, and theory of mind. Deficits in IJA provide strong early indicators for autism spectrum disorder, and therapies targeting joint attention have shown tremendous promise. However, the brain systems underlying IJA in early childhood are poorly understood, due in part to significant methodological challenges in imaging localized brain function that supports social behaviors during the first 2 years of life. Herein, we show that the functional organization of the brain is intimately related to the emergence of IJA using functional connectivity magnetic resonance imaging and dimensional behavioral assessments in a large semilongitudinal cohort of infants and toddlers. In particular, though functional connections spanning the brain are involved in IJA, the strongest brain-behavior associations cluster within connections between a small subset of functional brain networks; namely between the visual network and dorsal attention network and between the visual network and posterior cingulate aspects of the default mode network. These observations mark the earliest known description of how functional brain systems underlie a burgeoning fundamental social behavior, may help improve the design of targeted therapies for neurodevelopmental disorders, and, more generally, elucidate physiological mechanisms essential to healthy social behavior development. © The Author 2017.

      "abstract={Finding underlying relationships among multiple imaging modalities in a coherent fashion is one of the challenging problems in multimodal analysis. In this study, we propose a novel approach based on multidimensional persistence. In the extension of the previous threshold-free method of persistent homology, we visualize and discriminate the topological change of integrated brain networks by varying not only threshold but also mixing ratio between two different imaging modalities. The multidimensional persistence is implemented by a new bimodal integration method called 1D projection. When the mixing ratio is predefined, it constructs an integrated edge weight matrix by projecting two different connectivity information onto the one dimensional shared space. We applied the proposed methods to PET and MRI data from 23 attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) children, 21 autism spectrum disorder (ASD), and 10 pediatric control subjects. From the results, we found that the brain networks of ASD, ADHD children and controls differ, with ASD and ADHD showing asymmetrical changes of connected structures between metabolic and morphological connectivities. The difference of connected structure between ASD and the controls was mainly observed in the metabolic connectivity. However, ADHD showed the maximum difference when two connectivity information were integrated with the ratio 0.6. These results provide a multidimensional homological understanding of disease-related PET and MRI networks that disclose the network association with ASD and ADHD.

      "abstract={Research in humans and nonhuman animals indicates that social affiliation, and particularly maternal bonding, depends on reward circuitry. Although numerous mechanistic studies in rodents demonstrated that maternal bonding depends on striatal dopamine transmission, the neurochemistry supporting maternal behavior in humans has not been described so far. In this study, we tested the role of central dopamine in human bonding. We applied a combined functional MRI-PET scanner to simultaneously probe mothers' dopamine responses to their infants and the connectivity between the nucleus accumbens (NAcc), the amygdala, and the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC), which form an intrinsic network (referred to as the \"medial amygdala network\") that supports social functioning. We also measured the mothers' behavioral synchrony with their infants and plasma oxytocin. The results of this study suggest that synchronous maternal behavior is associated with increased dopamine responses to the mother's infant and stronger intrinsic connectivity within the medial amygdala network. Moreover, stronger network connectivity is associated with increased dopamine responses within the network and decreased plasma oxytocin. Together, these data indicate that dopamine is involved in human bonding. Compared with other mammals, humans have an unusually complex social life. The complexity of human bonding cannot be fully captured in nonhuman animal models, particularly in pathological bonding, such as that in autistic spectrum disorder or postpartum depression. Thus, investigations of the neurochemistry of social bonding in humans, for which this study provides initial evidence, are warranted. © 2017, National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.},\n",

However, the neural mechanism underlying these associations is still unclear. Relative to controls, patients with these psychiatric conditions show differences in brain structure, and in resting state fMRI (rs-fMRI) signal synchronicity among default mode network (DMN) regions (also known as functional connectivity). We used a stepwise imaging genetics approach in 328 healthy young adults to test the hypothesis that 10 SNPs in OXTR are associated with differences in DMN synchronicity and structure of some of the associated brain regions. As OXTR effects may be sex-dependent, we also tested whether our findings were modulated by sex. OXTR rs2254298 A allele carriers had significantly lower rsFC with PCC in a cluster extending from the right fronto-insular cortex to the putamen and globus pallidus, and in bilateral dorsal anterior cingulate cortex (dACC) compared to individuals with the GG genotype; all observed effects were found only in males. Moreover, compared to the male individuals with GG genotype ofrs2254298, the male A allele carriers demonstrated significantly thinner cortical gray matter in the bilateral dACC. Our findings suggest that there may be sexually dimorphic mechanisms by which a naturally occurring variation of the OXTR gene may influence brain structure and function in DMN-related regions implicated in neuropsychiatric disorders. © 2016 Elsevier Inc.},\n",

      "abstract={One major problem in neuroscience is the comparison of functional brain networks of different populations, e.g., distinguishing the networks of controls and patients. Traditional algorithms are based on search for isomorphism between networks, assuming that they are deterministic. However, biological networks present randomness that cannot be well modeled by those algorithms. For instance, functional brain networks of distinct subjects of the same population can be different due to individual characteristics. Moreover, networks of subjects from different populations can be generated through the same stochastic process. Thus, a better hypothesis is that networks are generated by random processes. In this case, subjects from the same group are samples from the same random process, whereas subjects from different groups are generated by distinct processes. Using this idea, we developed a statistical test called ANOGVA to test whether two or more populations of graphs are generated by the same random graph model. Our simulations' results demonstrate that we can precisely control the rate of false positives and that the test is powerful to discriminate random graphs generated by different models and parameters. The method also showed to be robust for unbalanced data. As an example, we applied ANOGVA to an fMRI dataset composed of controls and patients diagnosed with autism or Asperger. ANOGVA identified the cerebellar functional sub-network as statistically different between controls and autism (p < 0.001). © 2017 Fujita, Vidal and Takahashi.},\n",

      "abstract={The behaviors that define autism spectrum disorders (ASDs) have been hypothesized to result from disordered communication within brain networks. Several groups have investigated this question using resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (RS-fMRI). However, the published findings to date have been inconsistent across laboratories. Prior RS-fMRI studies of ASD have employed conventional analysis techniques based on the assumption that intrinsic brain activity is exactly synchronous over widely separated parts of the brain. By relaxing the assumption of synchronicity and focusing, instead, on lags between time series, we have recently demonstrated highly reproducible patterns of temporally lagged activity in normal human adults. We refer to this analysis technique as resting-state lag analysis (RS-LA). Here, we report RS-LA as well as conventional analyses of RS-fMRI in adults with ASD and demographically matched controls. RS-LA analyses demonstrated significant group differences in rs-fMRI lag structure in frontopolar cortex, occipital cortex, and putamen. Moreover, the degree of abnormality in individuals was highly correlated with behavioral measures relevant to the diagnosis of ASD. In this sample, no significant group differences were observed using conventional RS-fMRI analysis techniques. Our results suggest that altered propagation of intrinsic activity may contribute to abnormal brain function in ASD. © The Author 2015. Published by Oxford University Press. All rights reserved.

Here, we tested whether these memory deficits reflect a reduction in the probability of retrieval success or in the precision of memory representations. We also used functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to study the neural mechanisms underlying memory encoding and retrieval in ASD, focusing particularly on the functional connectivity of core episodic memory networks. Adults with ASD and typical control participants completed a memory task that involved studying visual displays and subsequently using a continuous dial to recreate their appearance. The ASD group exhibited reduced retrieval success, but there was no evidence of a difference in retrieval precision. fMRI data revealed similar patterns of brain activity and functional connectivity during memory encoding in the 2 groups, though encoding-related lateral frontal activity predicted subsequent retrieval success only in the control group. During memory retrieval, the ASD group exhibited attenuated lateral frontal activity and substantially reduced hippocampal connectivity, particularly between hippocampus and regions of the fronto-parietal control network. These findings demonstrate notable differences in brain function during episodic memory retrieval in ASD and highlight the importance of functional connectivity to understanding recollection-related retrieval deficits in this population. © The Author 2017.

      "abstract={This paper presents a new approach for detecting major differences in brain activities between Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) patients and neurotypical subjects using the resting state fMRI. Further the method also extracts discriminative features for an accurate diagnosis of ASD. The proposed approach determines a spatial filter that projects the covariance matrices of the Blood Oxygen Level Dependent (BOLD) time-series signals from both the ASD patients and neurotypical subjects in orthogonal directions such that they are highly separable. The inverse of this filter also provides a spatial pattern map within the brain that highlights those regions responsible for the distinguishable activities between the ASD patients and neurotypical subjects. For a better classification, highly discriminative log-variance features providing the maximum separation between the two classes are extracted from the projected BOLD time-series data. A detailed study has been carried out using the publicly available data from the Autism Brain Imaging Data Exchange (ABIDE) consortium for the different gender and age-groups. The study results indicate that for all the above categories, the regional differences in resting state activities are more commonly found in the right hemisphere compared to the left hemisphere of the brain. Among males, a clear shift in activities to the prefrontal cortex is observed for ASD patients while other parts of the brain show diminished activities compared to neurotypical subjects. Among females, such a clear shift is not evident; however, several regions, especially in the posterior and medial portions of the brain show diminished activities due to ASD. Finally, the classification performance obtained using the log-variance features is found to be better when compared to earlier studies in the literature. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.},\n",

Rather than pursuing overly simplifying general hypotheses (i.e., under vs. over), we tested the hypothesis of atypical network distribution in ASD (i.e., the participation of unusual loci in distributed functional networks). Methods We used a selective high-quality data subset from the Autism Brain Imaging Data Exchange (including 111 ASD and 174 typically developing participants) and several graph theory metrics. Resting state functional magnetic resonance imaging data were preprocessed and analyzed for the detection of low-frequency intrinsic signal correlations. Groups were tightly matched for available demographics and head motion. Results As hypothesized, the Rand index (reflecting how similar network organization was to a normative set of networks) was significantly lower in participants with ASD compared with typically developing participants. This was accounted for by globally reduced cohesion and density but increased dispersion of networks. While differences in hub architecture did not survive correction, rich club connectivity (among the hubs) was increased in the ASD group. Conclusions Our findings support the model of reduced network integration (i.e., connectivity within networks) and differentiation (or segregation; based on connectivity outside network boundaries) in ASD. While the findings were applied at the global level, they were not equally robust across all networks and in one case (i.e., greater cohesion within ventral attention network in ASD) even reversed. © 2016 Society of Biological Psychiatry},\n",

These observations converge to implicate thalamocortical connectivity as a potential unifying neural mechanism. The goal of this study was to clarify mixed findings on thalamocortical functional connectivity in a large sample of individuals with ASD. Methods Using the Autism Brain Imaging Data Exchange, we examined thalamocortical functional connectivity in 228 individuals with ASD and a matched comparison group of 228 typically developing individuals. To fully characterize thalamocortical functional networks, we employed complementary seed-based approaches that examined connectivity of major cortical divisions (e.g., prefrontal cortex, temporal lobe) with the thalamus and whole-brain connectivity of specific thalamic subregions. Results The prefrontal cortex, temporal lobe, and sensorimotor cortex exhibited hyperconnectivity with the thalamus in individuals with ASD. In the whole-brain analysis, hyperconnectivity of several thalamic seeds included multiple cortical areas but tended to converge in temporal cortical areas, including the temporoparietal junction. Follow-up analyses of age effects revealed that the connectivity abnormalities in individuals with ASD were more pronounced in adolescents compared with children and adults. Conclusions These results confirm previous findings of temporal and motor thalamocortical hyperconnectivity in ASD and extend them to include somatosensory and prefrontal cortices. Although not directly addressable with the data available in the Autism Brain Imaging Data Exchange, this widespread hyperconnectivity could theoretically account for sensorimotor symptoms and general cortical excitability in ASD. Future studies should target comprehensive clinical and behavioral characterization in combination with functional connectivity to explore this possibility. © 2016 Society of Biological Psychiatry},\n",

      "abstract={The use of a variety of neuroanatomical techniques has led to a greater understanding of the adverse effects of stress on psychiatric health. One recent advance that has been particularly valuable is the development of resting state functional connectivity (RSFC) in clinical studies. The current study investigates changes in RSFC in F1 adult female rats exposed to the early life chronic social stress (ECSS) of the daily introduction of a novel male intruder to the cage of their F0 mothers while the F1 pups are in the cage. This ECSS for the F1 animals consists of depressed maternal care from their F0 mothers and exposure to conflict between their F0 mothers and intruder males. Analyses of the functional connectivity data in ECSS exposed adult females versus control females reveal broad changes in the limbic and reward systems, the salience and introspective socioaffective networks, and several additional stress and social behavior associated nuclei. Substantial changes in connectivity were found in the prefrontal cortex, nucleus accumbens, hippocampus, and somatosensory cortex. The current rodent RSFC data support the hypothesis that the exposure to early life social stress has long term effects on neural connectivity in numerous social behavior, stress, and depression relevant brain nuclei. Future conscious rodent RSFC studies can build on the wealth of data generated from previous neuroanatomical studies of early life stress and enhance translational connectivity between animal and human fMRI studies in the development of novel preventative measures and treatments. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.},\n",

Currently, it is still challenging to understand the differences of brain activity between ASD and healthy children. In this study, we propose calculating the Rényi entropy of the eigenvalues derived from the signal correlation matrix to measure the global synchronization in multichannel electroencephalograph (EEG) from 16 children with ASD (aged 8-12 years) and 16 age- and sex-matched healthy controls at the resting state. The results indicate that there is a significantly diminished global synchronization from ASD to healthy control. The proposed method can help to reveal the intrinsic characteristics of multichannel EEG signals in children with ASD and aspects that distinguish them from healthy children. © 2017 by the authors.},\n",

      "abstract={Major psychiatric disorders, including attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), autism (AUT), bipolar disorder (BD), major depressive disorder (MDD), and schizophrenia (SZ), are highly heritable and polygenic. Evidence suggests that these five disorders have both shared and distinct genetic risks and neural connectivity abnormalities. To measure aggregate genetic risks, the polygenic risk score (PGRS) was computed. Two independent general populations (N = 360 and N = 323) were separately examined to investigate whether the cross-disorder PGRS and PGRS for a specific disorder were associated with individual variability in functional connectivity. Consistent altered functional connectivity was found with the bilateral insula: for the left supplementary motor area and the left superior temporal gyrus with the cross-disorder PGRS, for the left insula and right middle and superior temporal lobe associated with the PGRS for autism, for the bilateral midbrain, posterior cingulate, cuneus, and precuneus associated with the PGRS for BD, and for the left angular gyrus and the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex associated with the PGRS for schizophrenia. No significant functional connectivity was found associated with the PGRS for ADHD and MDD. Our findings indicated that genetic effects on the cross-disorder and disorder-specific neural connectivity of common genetic risk loci are detectable in the general population. Our findings also indicated that polygenic risk contributes to the main neurobiological phenotypes of psychiatric disorders and that identifying cross-disorder and specific functional connectivity related to polygenic risks may elucidate the neural pathways for these disorders. © 2017 The Authors},\n",

      "abstract={Autism postmortem studies have shown various cytoarchitectural anomalies in cortical and limbic areas including increased cell packing density, laminar disorganization, and narrowed minicolumns. However, there is little evidence on dendritic and axonal organization in ASD. Recent imaging techniques have the potential for non-invasive, in vivo studies of small-scale structure in the human brain, including gray matter. Here, Restriction Spectrum Imaging (RSI), a multi-shell diffusion-weighted imaging technique, was used to examine gray matter microstructure in 24 children with ASD (5 female) and 20 matched typically developing (TD) participants (2 female), ages 7-17 years. RSI extends the spherical deconvolution model to multiple length scales to characterize neurite density (ND) and organization. Measures were examined in 48 cortical regions of interest per hemisphere. To our knowledge, this is the first time that a multi-compartmental diffusion model has been applied to cortical gray matter in ASD. The ND measure detected robust age effects showing a significant positive relationship to age in all lobes except left temporal when groups were combined. Results were also suggestive of group differences (ASD < TD) in anterior cingulate, right superior temporal lobe and much of the parietal lobes, but these fell short of statistical significance. For MD, significant group differences (ASD > TD) in bilateral parietal regions as well as widespread age effects were detected. Our findings support the value of multi-shell diffusion imaging for assays of cortical gray matter. This approach has the potential to add to postmortem literature, examining intracortical organization, intracortical axonal content, myelination, or caliber. Robust age effects further support the validity of the ND metric for in vivo examination of gray matter microstructure in ASD and across development. While diffusion MRI does not approach the precision of histological studies, in vivo imaging measures of microstructure can complement postmortem studies, by allowing access to large sample sizes, a whole-brain field of view, longitudinal designs, and combination with behavioral and functional assays. This makes multi-shell diffusion imaging a promising technique for understanding the underlying cytoarchitecture of the disorder. © 2017 Carper, Treiber, White, Kohli and Müller.},\n",

      "abstract={Previous studies have found correlations between uneven intellectual development and autistic symptom severity but thus far each study has looked only at specific types of discrepancy score and results have been inconsistent. This study used the Autism Spectrum Quotient (AQ) and the British Ability Scales (second edition) to look for a correlation between autistic-like traits and an overall index of unevenness based on three types of discrepancy score, namely: discrepancies between IQ subscales; discrepancies between IQ domain scores; and, discrepancies between overall IQ and word-level literacy skills. The AQ scale was designed to measure autistic-like symptoms both in those with an Autism Spectrum Disorder and at all levels across the general population. The study sample was therefore not restricted to children with an ASD. The 106 school age participants had a mean IQ of 97 (SD 19.6) and a mean AQ (child version) score of 69.6 (SD 24.6). After controlling for IQ, each of the three intellectual discrepancy types accounted for unique variance in AQ with a large overall effect size. Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging studies are recommended to examine how far uneven intellectual development may be an analogue for aberrant cortical connectivity. © 2016 The Author(s).

We use network approach to characterization of spatiotemporal dynamics of EEG data in TD and ASD youths. EEG recorded during both wakeful rest (resting state) and a social–visual task was analyzed using cross-correlation analysis of the 32-channel time series to produce weighted, undirected graphs corresponding to functional brain networks. The stability of these networks was assessed by novel use of the L1-norm for matrix entries (edit distance). There were a significantly larger number of stable networks observed in the resting condition compared to the task condition in both populations. In resting state, stable networks persisted for a significantly longer time in children with ASD than in TD children; networks in ASD children also had larger diameter, indicative of long-range connectivity. The resulting analysis combines key features of microstate and network analyses of EEG. © 2016, The Author(s).},\n",

In this work, we develop flexible regression models and methods for determining differences in resting-state functional connectivity as a function of age, gender, drug intervention, or neuropsychiatric disorders. We propose two complementary methods for identifying changes of edges and subgraphs. (i) For detecting changes of edges, we select the optimal model at each edge and then conduct contrast tests to identify the effects of the important variables while controlling the familywise error rate. (ii) We adopt the network-based statistics method to improve power by incorporating the graph topological structure. Both methods have wide applications for low signal-to-noise ratio data. We propose stability criteria for the choice of threshold in the network-based statistics procedure and utilize efficient massive parallel procedure to speed up the estimation and inference procedure. Results from our simulation studies show that the thresholds chosen by the proposed stability criteria outperform the Bonferroni threshold. To demonstrate applicability, we use both methods in the context of the Oxytocin and Aging Study to determine effects of age, gender, and drug treatment on resting-state functional connectivity, as well as in the context of the Autism Brain Imaging Data Exchange Study to determine effects of autism spectrum disorder on functional connectivity at rest.

      "abstract={The human brain undergoes dramatic changes in amygdala-related functional connectivity network during adolescence. Given that the amygdala is a vital component of the “social brain”, the Amygdala Theory of Autism has been proposed to account for atypical patterns of socio-emotional behavior in autism. Most of the previous neuroimaging evidence has concentrated on local functional or structural abnormalities of the amygdala in relation to social deficits in autism, rather than on its integrated role as part of larger brain networks. To examine whether functional integration pattern of the amygdala is altered in autism, the current study examined sixty-five adolescent subjects (30 autism and 35 healthy controls, 12–18 years old) from two independent datasets (UCLA and Leuven) of the Autism Brain Imaging Data Exchange. Whole-brain resting-state functional connectivity maps seeded in the amygdala were calculated and compared between patient and control groups. Compared with healthy controls, adolescents with autism showed decreased functional connectivity between the amygdala and subcortical regions in both datasets, including the bilateral thalamus and right putamen. These findings support the Amygdala Theory of Autism, demonstrating altered functional connectivity pattern associated with the amygdala in autism, and provide new insights into the pathophysiology of autism. © 2016 Elsevier Ireland Ltd},\n",

Remaining completely still on command is a major achievement as involuntary fluctuations in our motions are difficult to keep under control. Here we examine the noise-to-signal ratio of micro-movements present in time-series of head motions extracted from resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging scans in 1048 participants. These included individuals with autism spectrum disorders (ASD) and healthy-controls in shared data from the Autism Brain Imaging Data Exchange (ABIDE) and the Attention-Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD-200) databases. We find excess noise and randomness in the ASD cases, suggesting an uncertain motor-feedback signal. A power-law emerged describing an orderly relation between the dispersion and shape of the probability distribution functions best describing the stochastic properties under consideration with respect to intelligence quotient (IQ-scores). In ASD, deleterious patterns of noise are consistently exacerbated with the presence of secondary (comorbid) neuropsychiatric diagnoses, lower verbal and performance intelligence, and autism severity. Importantly, such patterns in ASD are present whether or not the participant takes psychotropic medication.

The social deficits that characterize ASD may relate to reduced connectivity between brain sites on the mesolimbic reward pathway (nucleus accumbens; amygdala) that receive OT projections and contribute to social motivation, and cortical sites involved in social perception. Using functional magnetic resonance imaging and a randomized, double blind, placebo-controlled crossover design, we show that OT administration in ASD increases activity in brain regions important for perceiving social-emotional information. Further, OT enhances connectivity between nodes of the brain's reward and socioemotional processing systems, and does so preferentially for social (versus nonsocial) stimuli. This effect is observed both while viewing coherent versus scrambled biological motion, and while listening to happy versus angry voices. Our findings suggest a mechanism by which intranasal OT may bolster social motivation - one that could, in future, be harnessed to augment behavioral treatments for ASD.},\n",

      "abstract={Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a neurodevelopment disorder characterized by atypical connectivity within and across multiple brain systems. We aimed to explore information transmission from the sensory periphery to information processing centers of the brain across thalamo-cortical circuits in ASD. A large multicenter dataset from the autism brain imaging data exchange was utilized. A thalamus template derived from the Automatic Anatomic Labeling atlas was subdivided into six subregions corresponding to six cortical regions using a “winner-takes-all” strategy. Granger causality analysis (GCA) was then applied to calculate effective connectivity from subregions of the thalamus to the corresponding cortical regions. Results demonstrate reduced effective connectivity from the thalamus to left prefrontal cortex (P = 0.023), right posterior parietal cortex (P = 0.03), and bilateral temporal cortex (left: P = 0.014; right: P = 0.015) in ASD compared with healthy control (HC) participants. The GCA values of the thalamus-bilateral temporal cortex connections were significantly negatively correlated with communication scores as assessed by the autism diagnostic observation schedule in the ASD group (left: P = 0.037; right: P = 0.007). Age-related analyses showed that the strengths of the thalamus-bilateral temporal cortex connections were significantly positively correlated with age in the HC group (left: P = 0.013; right: P = 0.016), but not in the ASD group (left: P = 0.506; right: P = 0.219). These results demonstrate impaired thalamo-cortical information transmission in ASD and suggest that atypical development of thalamus-temporal cortex connections may relate to communication deficits in the disorder.

      "abstract={Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is characterized by atypical brain network organization, but findings have been inconsistent. While methodological and maturational factors have been considered, the network specificity of connectivity abnormalities remains incompletely understood. We investigated intrinsic functional connectivity (iFC) for four \"core\" functional networks - default-mode (DMN), salience (SN), and left (lECN) and right executive control (rECN). Resting-state functional MRI data from 75 children and adolescents (37 ASD, 38 typically developing [TD]) were included. Functional connectivity within and between networks was analyzed for regions of interest (ROIs) and whole brain, compared between groups, and correlated with behavioral scores. ROI analyses showed overconnectivity (ASD > TD), especially between DMN and ECN. Whole-brain results were mixed. While predominant overconnectivity was found for DMN (posterior cingulate seed) and rECN (right inferior parietal seed), predominant underconnectivity was found for SN (right anterior insula seed) and lECN (left inferior parietal seed). In the ASD group, reduced SN integrity was associated with sensory and sociocommunicative symptoms. In conclusion, atypical connectivity in ASD is network-specific, ranging from extensive overconnectivity (DMN, rECN) to extensive underconnectivity (SN, lECN). Links between iFC and behavior differed between groups. Core symptomatology in the ASD group was predominantly related to connectivity within the salience network. © 2015 The Author 2015.

The ictal propagation pathway is homogeneous and established, thus creating the optimum situation for the proposed method validation study. Twelve patients with seizures from hypothalamic hamartoma and six normal control patients underwent resting-state functional MRI, using independent component analysis (ICA) to identify network differences in patients. This was followed by seed-based connectivity measures to determine the extent of fc derangement between hypothalamus and these areas. The areas with significant change in connectivity were compared with the results of prior studies' modalities used to evaluate seizure propagation. The left amygdala-parahippocampal gyrus area, cingulate gyrus, and occipitotemporal gyrus demonstrated the highest derangement in connectivity with the hypothalamus, p < 0.01, corresponding to the initial seizure propagation areas established by prior modalities. Areas of secondary ictal propagation were differentiated from these initial locations by first being identified as an abnormal neuronal signal source through ICA, but did not show significant connectivity directly with the known ictal focus. Noninvasive connectivity measures correspond to areas of initial ictal propagation and differentiate such areas from secondary ictal propagation, which may aid in ictal focus surgical disconnection planning and support the use of this newer modality for adjunctive information in epilepsy surgery evaluation. © Varina L.

      "abstract={In addition to the essential features of autism spectrum disorder (ASD), namely social communication deficits and repetitive behaviors, individuals with ASD may suffer from working memory deficits and an altered default-mode network (DMN). We hypothesized that an altered DMN is related to working memory deficits in those with ASD. A total of 37 adolescents with ASD and 36 age- and IQ-matched typically developing (TD) controls were analyzed. Visuospatial working memory performance was assessed using pattern recognition memory (PRM), spatial recognition memory (SRM), and paired-associates learning (PAL) tasks. The intrinsic functional connectivity (iFC) of the DMN was indexed by the temporal correlations between the resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging signals of pairs of DMN regions, including those between the posterior cingulate cortex (PCC) and medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) and between the PCC and parahippocampi (PHG). The corresponding structural connectivity of the DMN was indexed by the generalized fractional anisotropy (GFA) of the dorsal and ventral cingulum bundles on the basis of diffusion spectrum imaging data. The results showed that ASD adolescents exhibited delayed correct responses in PRM and SRM tasks and committed more errors in the PAL task than the TD controls did. The delayed responses during the PRM and SRM tasks were negatively correlated with bilateral PCC–mPFC iFCs, and PAL performance was negatively correlated with right PCC–PHG iFC in ASD adolescents. Furthermore, ASD adolescents showed significant lower GFA in the right cingulum bundles than the TD group did; the GFA value was negatively correlated with SRM performance in ASD. Our results provide empirical evidence for deficient visuospatial working memory and corresponding neural correlates within the DMN in adolescents with ASD.

In recent years, the question of how functional networks develop and mature in children has been a hotly discussed topic. In this review, we examined the developmental characteristics of functional networks and the impacts of skill training on children's brains. We first focused on the general rules of brain network development and on the typical and atypical development of children's brain networks. After that, we highlighted the essentials of neural plasticity and the effects of learning on brain network development. We also discussed two important theoretical and practical concerns in brain network training.

      "abstract={Introduction: Autism is a neuro-developmental disorder which is manifested as impairment of social interaction, communication and a repetitive behaviour. Autism can obscure dental treatment for the affected patients; furthermore, children with autism commonly have destructive oral habits. Aim: The aims of this study were to evaluate the Modified Gingival Index (MGI), Plaque Index (PI), salivary pH and buffering capacity of the saliva among autistic children compared to normal children in Riyadh City that may provide baseline data to enable comparison and future planning of dental services for autistic children. Materials and Methods: A total of 50 children diagnosed with autism (mean age 8.5 years) were selected from Azzam Autism School, Riyadh City. The control group consisted of 50 nonautistic school children (mean age 8.7 years), gender matched, selected from Outpatient Clinic, Riyadh Colleges of Dentistry and Pharmacy. MGI, PI, salivary pH and salivary buffer capacity tests were done for all participants. The buffering capacity of the stimulated saliva was grouped under ‘very low’, ‘low’ and ‘normal’. Pearson’s Chi square and one way ANOVA were used to find statistical significance if any among the autistic and the normal control group. Results: The results of the study showed that the mean ± standard deviation of MGI, PI and pH of unstimulated resting saliva for autistic group were 1.82 ± 0.65, 1.92 ± 0.35 and 6.8 ± 0.5 respectively. Normal control group had values 1.35 ± 0.85, 1.44 ± 0.43 and 7 ± 0.4 respectively. A statistically significant difference between both groups for all parameters was found. Salivary buffering capacity was found to be normal for the majority among both groups. However, 60% children among the autistic group presented with normal buffering capacity of the stimulated saliva as compared to 70% among the normal control group. However, this difference was not statistically significant (p = 0.544). Conclusion: Children with autism appear to have higher gingival inflammation, poor oral hygiene and a slightly lower salivary pH as compared to healthy control group. Special oral health programmes regarding treatment and maintenance of good oral health should be taken in consideration for autistic children. © 2016, Journal of Clinical and Diagnostic Research.

      "abstract={Mutations in a synaptic organizing pathway contribute to autism. Autism-associated mutations in MDGA2 (MAM domain containing glycosylphosphatidylinositol anchor 2) are thought to reduce excitatory/inhibitory transmission. However, we show that mutation of Mdga2 elevates excitatory transmission, and that MDGA2 blocks neuroligin-1 interaction with neurexins and suppresses excitatory synapse development. Mdga2+/− mice, modeling autism mutations, demonstrated increased asymmetric synapse density, mEPSC frequency and amplitude, and altered LTP, with no change in measures of inhibitory synapses. Behavioral assays revealed an autism-like phenotype including stereotypy, aberrant social interactions, and impaired memory. In vivo voltage-sensitive dye imaging, facilitating comparison with fMRI studies in autism, revealed widespread increases in cortical spontaneous activity and intracortical functional connectivity. These results suggest that mutations in MDGA2 contribute to altered cortical processing through the dual disadvantages of elevated excitation and hyperconnectivity, and indicate that perturbations of the NRXN-NLGN pathway in either direction from the norm increase risk for autism. © 2016 Elsevier Inc.},\n",

      "abstract={Objective The objective of this study was to determine whether functional connectivity of the amygdala is altered in preschool-age children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and to assess the clinical relevance of observed alterations in amygdala connectivity. Method A resting-state functional connectivity magnetic resonance imaging study of the amygdala (and a parallel study of primary visual cortex) was conducted in 72 boys (mean age 3.5 years; n = 43 with ASD; n = 29 age-matched controls). Results The ASD group showed significantly weaker connectivity between the amygdala and several brain regions involved in social communication and repetitive behaviors, including bilateral medial prefrontal cortex, temporal lobes, and striatum (p < 05, corrected). Weaker connectivity between the amygdala and frontal and temporal lobes was significantly correlated with increased autism severity in the ASD group (p < 05). In a parallel analysis examining the functional connectivity of primary visual cortex, the ASD group showed significantly weaker connectivity between visual cortex and sensorimotor regions (p < 05, corrected). Weaker connectivity between visual cortex and sensorimotor regions was not correlated with core autism symptoms, but instead was correlated with increased sensory hypersensitivity in the visual/auditory domain (p < 05). Conclusion These findings indicate that preschool-age children with ASD have disrupted functional connectivity between the amygdala and regions of the brain important for social communication and language, which might be clinically relevant because weaker connectivity was associated with increased autism severity. Moreover, although amygdala connectivity was associated with behavioral domains that are diagnostic of ASD, altered connectivity of primary visual cortex was related to sensory hypersensitivity. © 2016 American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry},\n",

We use a novel Bayesian framework to extract network-based differences before and after a 16-week pivotal response treatment (PRT) regimen. Our results suggest that the functional changes induced by PRT localize to the posterior cingulate and are marked by a shift in connectivity from the orbitofrontal cortex to the occipital-temporal cortex. Our results illuminate a potential PRT-induced learning mechanism, whereby the neural circuits involved during social perception shift from sensory and attentional systems to higher-level object and face processing areas.

      "abstract={Functional brain networks demonstrate significant temporal variability and dynamic reconfiguration even in the resting state. Currently, most studies investigate temporal variability of brain networks at the scale of single (micro) or whole-brain (macro) connectivity. However, the mechanism underlying time-varying properties remains unclear, as the coupling between brain network variability and neural activity is not readily apparent when analysed at either micro or macroscales. We propose an intermediate (meso) scale analysis and characterize temporal variability of the functional architecture associated with a particular region. This yields a topography of variability that reflects the whole-brain and, most importantly, creates an analytical framework to establish the fundamental relationship between variability of regional functional architecture and its neural activity or structural connectivity. We find that temporal variability reflects the dynamical reconfiguration of a brain region into distinct functional modules at different times and may be indicative of brain flexibility and adaptability. Primary and unimodal sensory-motor cortices demonstrate low temporal variability, while transmodal areas, including heteromodal association areas and limbic system, demonstrate the high variability. In particular, regions with highest variability such as hippocampus/parahippocampus, inferior and middle temporal gyrus, olfactory gyrus and caudate are all related to learning, suggesting that the temporal variability may indicate the level of brain adaptability. With simultaneously recorded electroencephalography/functional magnetic resonance imaging and functional magnetic resonance imaging/diffusion tensor imaging data, we also find that variability of regional functional architecture is modulated by local blood oxygen level-dependent activity and α-band oscillation, and is governed by the ratio of intra- to inter-community structural connectivity. Application of the mesoscale variability measure to multicentre datasets of three mental disorders and matched controls involving 1180 subjects reveals that those regions demonstrating extreme, i.e. highest/lowest variability in controls are most liable to change in mental disorders. Specifically, we draw attention to the identification of diametrically opposing patterns of variability changes between schizophrenia and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder/autism. Regions of the default-mode network demonstrate lower variability in patients with schizophrenia, but high variability in patients with autism/attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, compared with respective controls. In contrast, subcortical regions, especially the thalamus, show higher variability in schizophrenia patients, but lower variability in patients with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder. The changes in variability of these regions are also closely related to symptom scores. Our work provides insights into the dynamic organization of the resting brain and how it changes in brain disorders. The nodal variability measure may also be potentially useful as a predictor for learning and neural rehabilitation. © 2016 The Author (2016).

Currently it is assumed that these difficulties might have neurobiological correlates in alterations in activation as well as in connectivity in and between regions of the social perception network suggested to govern the processing of social cues. In this study, we conducted functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI)-based activation and connectivity analyses focusing on face-, voice-, and audiovisual-processing brain regions as the most important subareas of the social perception network. Results revealed alterations in connectivity among regions involved in the processing of social stimuli in ASD subjects compared to typically developed (TD) controls—specifically, a reduced connectivity between the left temporal voice area (TVA) and the superior and medial frontal gyrus. Alterations in connectivity, moreover, were correlated with the severity of autistic traits: correlation analysis indicated that the connectivity between the left TVA and the limbic lobe, anterior cingulate and the medial frontal gyrus as well as between the right TVA and the frontal lobe, anterior cingulate, limbic lobe and the caudate decreased with increasing symptom severity. As these frontal regions are understood to play an important role in interpreting and mentalizing social signals, the observed underconnectivity might be construed as playing a role in social impairments in ASD. © 2016, Springer-Verlag Wien.},\n",

      "abstract={Background: Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) are frequently overlapping neurodevelopmental disorders. Individuals in whom the disorders are comorbid show more severe impairment because of deficits in the processing of social situations, adaptive functioning, and executive control than individuals with either disorder alone. Objective: This open-label pilot study aimed to evaluate and compare the efficacy and tolerability of risperidone and aripiprazole for treating ADHD symptoms in patients with both ASD and ADHD over the course of 24 weeks of treatment. Methods: Patients (n = 44) were randomly assigned to start treatment with risperidone (22 patients) or aripiprazole (22 patients). Children were evaluated before starting treatment (T0), and after 12 weeks (T1) and 24 weeks (T2) of treatment. At each visit, specific psychiatric clinical scales were administered to assess the efficacy of the two drugs. Results: The mean age was 8.4 ± 2.9 years in the aripiprazole group and 7.8 ± 2.3 years in the risperidone group. A total of 37 children (29 boys and 8 girls) completed the study (18 in the aripiprazole group and 19 in the risperidone group). Aripiprazole and risperidone appeared to have similar benefits in terms of efficacy and tolerability, although there were slight differences between the two drugs. Both groups showed a significant improvement in ADHD symptoms after 24 weeks of treatment (ADHD Rating Scale, Conners Parent Rating Scale–Hyperactivity, and Clinical Global Improvement–Severity Scale). No significant difference between the two drugs on any parameters at 24 weeks were found. Prolactin levels were decreased in the aripiprazole group. Both drugs were well tolerated, with no serious adverse events detected. Conclusions: Our study confirms the efficacy of both aripiprazole and risperidone in ameliorating ADHD symptoms of children also presenting with ASD. © 2016, Springer International Publishing Switzerland.},\n",

      "abstract={It is often reported that children with oppositional defiant disorder (ODD) or conduct disorder (CD) are under-aroused. However, the evidence is mixed, with some children with ODD/CD displaying high arousal. This has led to the hypothesis that different profiles of arousal dysfunction may exist within children with ODD/CD. This knowledge could explain variability within children with ODD/CD, both in terms of specific types of aggression as well as comorbid symptoms (e.g., other emotional/behavioral problems). We measured heart rate variability (HRV), heart rate (HR) and skin conductance level (SCL) during rest and stress, and obtained parent and teacher reports of aggression, anxiety, attention problems and autism traits in a sample of 66 ODD/CD and 36 non-clinical boys (aged 8–12 years). The ODD/CD group scored significantly higher on aggression, anxiety, attention problems and autism traits than the controls; boys with ODD/CD also had higher resting HRs than controls, but HR stress, HRV and SCL did not differ. Hierarchical regressions showed different physiological profiles in subgroups of boys with ODD/CD based on their type of aggression; a pattern of high baseline HR and SCL, but low stress HRV was related to reactive aggression, whereas the opposite physiological pattern (low HR, low stress SCL, high stress HRV) was related to proactive aggression. Furthermore, high stress SCL was related to anxiety symptoms, whereas low stress SCL was related to attention problems. These findings are important because they indicate heterogeneity within boys with ODD/CD and highlight the importance of using physiology to differentiate boys with different ODD/CD subtypes. © 2015, The Author(s).},\n",

      "abstract={Domoic acid (DA) is a toxin produced by marine algae and known primarily for its role in isolated outbreaks of Amnestic Shellfish Poisoning and for the damage it inflicts on marine mammals, particularly California sea lions. Lethal effects of DA are often preceded by seizures and coma. Exposure to DA during development can result in subtle and highly persistent effects on brain development and include behavioral changes that resemble diagnostic features of schizophrenia and anomalies in social behavior we believe are relevant to autism spectrum disorder (ASD). To more fully examine this hypothesis, we chose to examine adolescent mice exposed in utero to DA for endpoints relevant to ASD, specifically changes in social behavior and network structure, the latter measured by resting state functional connectivity (rs-fcMRI). We found that male offspring exposed in utero to DA expressed reproducible declines in social interaction and atypical patterns of functional connectivity in the anterior cingulate, a region of the default mode network that is critical for social functioning. We also found disruptions in global topology in regions involved in the processing of reward, social, and sensory experiences. Finally, we found that DA exposed males expressed a pattern of local over-connectivity. These anomalies in brain connectivity bear resemblance to connectivity patterns in ASD and help validate DA-exposed mice as a model of this mental disability. © 2016 Elsevier B.V..},\n",

      "abstract={Background Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) encompasses a complex manifestation of symptoms that include deficits in social interaction and repetitive or stereotyped interests and behaviors. In keeping with the increasing recognition of the dimensional characteristics of ASD symptoms and the categorical nature of a diagnosis, we sought to delineate the neural mechanisms of ASD symptoms based on the functional connectivity of four known neural networks (i.e., default mode network, dorsal attention network, salience network, and executive control network). Methods We leveraged an open data resource (Autism Brain Imaging Data Exchange) providing resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging data sets from 90 boys with ASD and 95 typically developing boys. This data set also included the Social Responsiveness Scale as a dimensional measure of ASD traits. Seed-based functional connectivity was paired with linear regression to identify functional connectivity abnormalities associated with categorical effects of ASD diagnosis, dimensional effects of ASD-like behaviors, and their interaction. Results Our results revealed the existence of dimensional mechanisms of ASD uniquely affecting each network based on the presence of connectivity-behavioral relationships; these were independent of diagnostic category. However, we also found evidence of categorical differences (i.e., diagnostic group differences) in connectivity strength for each network as well as categorical differences in connectivity-behavioral relationships (i.e., diagnosis-by-behavior interactions), supporting the coexistence of categorical mechanisms of ASD. Conclusions Our findings support a hybrid model for ASD characterization that includes a combination of categorical and dimensional brain mechanisms and provide a novel understanding of the neural underpinnings of ASD. © 2016 Society of Biological Psychiatry},\n",

      "abstract={Introduction: The relationship between participant motion, demographic variables and MRI-derived morphometric estimates was investigated in autism spectrum disorder (ASD), attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), schizophrenia and healthy controls. Participant motion was estimated using resting state fMRI and used as a proxy measure for motion during T1w MRI acquired in the same session. Analyses were carried out in scans qualitatively assessed as free from motion-related artifact. Methods: Whole brain T1-weighted MRI and resting state fMRI acquisitions from the ABIDE, ADHD-200 and COBRE databases were included in our analyses. Motion was estimated using coregistration of sequential resting state volumes. We investigated if motion is related to diagnosis, age and gender, and scanning site. We further determined if there is a relationship between participant motion and cortical thickness, contrast, and volumetric estimates. Results: 2141 participants were included in our analyses. Participant motion was higher in all clinical groups compared with healthy controls. Younger (age &lt; 20 years) and older (age &gt; 40 years) people move more than individuals aged 20-40 years. Increased motion is associated with reduced average cortical thickness (-0.014 mm thickness per mm motion, p = 0.0014) and cortical contrast (0.77% contrast reduction per mm motion, p = 2.16 × 10-9) in scans that have been qualitatively assessed as free from motion artifact. Volumetric estimates were also associated with motion, however the relationships were generally weaker than cortical thickness and contrast and were dependent on the segmentation method used. Conclusions: Participant motion is increased in clinical groups and is systematically associated with morphometric estimates. These findings indicate that accounting for participant motion may be important for improving the statistical validity of morphometric studies. © 2016.},\n",

      "abstract={Background: Atypical lateralization of language-related functions has been repeatedly found in individuals with autism spectrum conditions (ASC). Few studies have, however, investigated deviations from typically occurring asymmetry of other lateralized cognitive and behavioural domains. Motor deficits are among the earliest and most prominent symptoms in individuals with ASC and precede core social and communicative symptoms. Methods: Here, we investigate whether motor circuit connectivity is (1) atypically lateralized in children with ASC and (2) whether this relates to core autistic symptoms and motor performance. Participants comprised 44 right-handed high-functioning children with autism (36 males, 8 females) and 80 typically developing control children (58 males, 22 females) matched on age, sex and performance IQ. We examined lateralization of functional motor circuit connectivity based on homotopic seeds derived from peak activations during a finger tapping paradigm. Motor performance was assessed using the Physical and Neurological Examination for Subtle Signs (PANESS). Results: Children with ASC showed rightward lateralization in mean motor circuit connectivity compared to typically developing children, and this was associated with poorer performance on all three PANESS measures. Conclusions: Our findings reveal that atypical lateralization in ASC is not restricted to language functions but is also present in circuits subserving motor functions and may underlie motor deficits in children with ASC. Future studies should investigate whether this is an age-invariant finding extending to adolescents and adults and whether these asymmetries relate to atypical lateralization in the language domain. © 2016 The Author(s).},\n",

      "abstract={Objective The salience network, an intrinsic brain network thought to modulate attention to internal versus external stimuli, has been consistently found to be atypical in autism spectrum disorders (ASD). However, little is known about how this altered resting-state connectivity relates to brain activity during information processing, which has important implications for understanding sensory overresponsivity (SOR), a common and impairing condition in ASD related to difficulty downregulating brain responses to sensory stimuli. This study examined how SOR in youth with ASD relates to atypical salience network connectivity and whether these atypicalities are associated with abnormal brain response to basic sensory information. Method Functional magnetic resonance imaging was used to examine how parent-rated SOR symptoms related to salience network connectivity in 61 youth (aged 8−17 years; 28 with ASD and 33 IQ-matched typically developing youth). Correlations between resting-state salience network connectivity and brain response to mildly aversive tactile and auditory stimuli were examined. Results SOR in youth with ASD was related to increased resting-state functional connectivity between salience network nodes and brain regions implicated in primary sensory processing and attention. Furthermore, the strength of this connectivity at rest was related to the extent of brain activity in response to auditory and tactile stimuli. Conclusion Results support an association between intrinsic brain connectivity and specific atypical brain responses during information processing. In addition, findings suggest that basic sensory information is overly salient to individuals with SOR, leading to overattribution of attention to this information. Implications for intervention include incorporating sensory coping strategies into social interventions for individuals with SOR. © 2016 American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry},\n",

      "abstract={Background Females and males differ significantly in the prevalence and presentation of autism spectrum conditions. One theory of this effect postulates that autistic traits lie on a sex-related continuum in the general population, and autism represents the extreme male end of this spectrum. This theory predicts that any feature of autism in males should 1) be present in autistic females, 2) differentiate between the sexes in the typical population, and 3) correlate with autistic traits. We tested these three predictions for default mode network (DMN) hypoconnectivity during the resting state, one of the most robustly found neurobiological differences in autism. Methods We analyzed a primary dataset of adolescents (N = 121, 12-18 years of age) containing a relatively large number of females and a replication multisite dataset including children, adolescents, and adults (N = 980, 6-58 years of age). We quantified the average connectivity between DMN regions and tested for group differences and correlation with behavioral performance using robust regression. Results We found significant differences in DMN intraconnectivity between female controls and females with autism (p =.001 in the primary dataset; p =.009 in the replication dataset), and between female controls and male controls (p =.036 in the primary dataset; p =.002 in the replication dataset). We also found a significant correlation between DMN intraconnectivity and performance on a mentalizing task (p =.001) in the primary dataset. Conclusions Collectively, these findings provide the first evidence for DMN hypoconnectivity as a behaviorally relevant neuroimaging phenotype of the sex-related spectrum of autistic traits, of which autism represents the extreme case. © 2016 Society of Biological Psychiatry.},\n",

      "abstract={The amygdala is a complex structure with distinct subregions and dissociable functional networks. The laterobasal subregion of the amygdala is hypothesized to mediate the presentation and severity of autism symptoms, although very little data are available regarding amygdala dysfunction at the subregional level. In this study, we investigated the relationship between abnormal amygdalar intrinsic connectivity, autism symptom severity, and anxiety and depressive symptoms. We collected resting state fMRI data on 31 high functioning adolescents and adults with autism spectrum disorder and 38 typically developing (TD) controls aged 14–45. Twenty-five participants with ASD and 28 TD participants were included in the final analyses. ASD participants were administered the Autism Diagnostic Interview–Revised and the Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule. Adult participants were administered the Beck Depression Inventory II and the Beck Anxiety Inventory. Functional connectivity analyses were conducted from three amygdalar subregions: centromedial (CM), laterobasal (LB) and superficial (SF). In addition, correlations with the behavioral measures were tested in the adult participants. In general, the ASD group showed significantly decreased connectivity from the LB subregion and increased connectivity from the CM and SF subregions compared to the TD group. We found evidence that social symptoms are primarily associated with under-connectivity from the LB subregion whereas over-connectivity and under-connectivity from the CM, SF and LB subregions are related to co-morbid depression and anxiety in ASD, in brain regions that were distinct from those associated with social dysfunction, and in different patterns than were observed in mildly symptomatic TD participants. Our findings provide new evidence for functional subregional differences in amygdala pathophysiology in ASD.

      "abstract={Resting-state functional MRI (rsfMRI) is a widely implemented technique used to investigate large-scale topology in the human brain during health and disease. Studies in mice provide additional advantages, including the possibility to flexibly modulate the brain by pharmacological or genetic manipulations in combination with high-throughput functional connectivity (FC) investigations. Pharmacological modulations that target specific neurotransmitter systems, partly mimicking the effect of pathological events, could allow discriminating the effect of specific systems on functional network disruptions. The current study investigated the effect of cholinergic and serotonergic antagonists on large-scale brain networks in mice. The cholinergic system is involved in cognitive functions and is impaired in, e.g., Alzheimer’s disease, while the serotonergic system is involved in emotional and introspective functions and is impaired in, e.g., Alzheimer’s disease, depression and autism. Specific interest goes to the default-mode-network (DMN), which is studied extensively in humans and is affected in many neurological disorders. The results show that both cholinergic and serotonergic antagonists impaired the mouse DMN-like network similarly, except that cholinergic modulation additionally affected the retrosplenial cortex. This suggests that both neurotransmitter systems are involved in maintaining integrity of FC within the DMN-like network in mice. Cholinergic and serotonergic modulations also affected other functional networks, however, serotonergic modulation impaired the frontal and thalamus networks more extensively. In conclusion, this study demonstrates the utility of pharmacological rsfMRI in animal models to provide insights into the role of specific neurotransmitter systems on functional networks in neurological disorders. © 2015, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.},\n",

      "abstract={Individuals with autism spectrum disorders (ASD) exhibit early and lifelong impairments in attention across multiple domains. While the disorder is known to affect attention processes, very little is currently known about the brain networks underlying attention in ASD, and even less is known about whether these atypicalities persist across the lifespan. We used functional connectivity analysis applied to resting state functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data to explore the dorsal (DAN) and ventral (VAN) attention networks in two separate age cohorts of children and adults with and without ASD. We find significant developmental differences in functional connectivity of brain regions that are critical for attention in children and adults with ASD. Specifically, children with ASD show hyper-connectivity of regions-of-interest (ROIs) in both attention networks compared with both typically developing (TD) children and adults with ASD. In contrast, adults with ASD show hypo-connectivity of these networks compared with neurotypical adults. These findings are consistent with the notion that consideration of developmental stage is critical in studies of functional connectivity in ASD.

We compared resting-state functional connectivity (rsFC) of regions involved in self-referential (e.g. medial prefrontal cortex; mPFC) and other-referential (e.g. posterior cingulate cortex; PCC) processing between neurotypical individuals and individuals with ASD in three age cohorts using regions of interest (ROIs) identified through an activation likelihood estimation meta-analysis.

      "abstract={Social and communicative impairments are among the core symptoms of autism spectrum disorders (ASD), and a great deal of evidence supports the notion that these impairments are associated with aberrant functioning and connectivity of various cortical networks. The present study explored the links between sources of MEG amplitude in various frequency bands and functional connectivity MRI in the resting state. The goal of combining these modalities was to use sources of neural oscillatory activity, measured with MEG, as functionally relevant seed regions for a more traditional pairwise fMRI connectivity analysis. We performed a seed-based connectivity analysis on resting state fMRI data, using seed regions derived from frequency-specific amplitude sources in resting state MEG data in the same nine subjects with ASD (10-17 years of age). We then compared fMRI connectivity among these MEG-source-derived regions between participants with autism and typically developing, age-matched controls. We used a source modeling technique designed for MEG data to detect significant amplitude sources in six frequency bands: delta (2-4 Hz), theta (4-8 Hz), alpha (8-12 Hz), beta (12-30 Hz), low gamma (30-60 Hz), and high gamma (60-120 Hz). MEG-derived source maps for each participant were co-registered in standard MNI space, and group-level source maps were obtained for each frequency. For each frequency band, the 10 largest clusters resulting from these t-tests were used as regions of interest (ROIs) for the fMRI functional connectivity analysis. Pairwise BOLD signal correlations were obtained between each pair of these ROIs for each frequency band. Each pairwise correlation was compared between the ASD and TD groups using t-tests. We also constrained these pairwise correlations to known network structures, resulting in a follow-up set of correlation matrices specific to each network we considered. Frequency-specific MEG sources had distinct patterns of fMRI resting state functional connectivity in the ASD group, but perhaps the most significant was a finding of hypoconnectivity between many sources of low and high gamma activity. These novel findings suggest that in ASD there are differences in functionally defined networks as shown in previous fMRI studies, as well as between sets of regions defined by magnetoencephalographic neural oscillatory activity. © 2016 Datko, Gougelet, Huang and Pineda.},\n",

      "abstract={Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is characterized by core sociocommunicative impairments. Atypical intrinsic functional connectivity (iFC) has been reported in numerous studies of ASD. A majority of findings has indicated long-distance underconnectivity. However, fMRI studies have thus far exclusively examined static iFC across several minutes of scanning. We examined temporal variability of iFC, using sliding window analyses in selected high-quality (low-motion) consortium datasets from 76 ASD and 76 matched typically developing (TD) participants (Study 1) and in-house data from 32 ASD and 32 TD participants. Mean iFC and standard deviation of the sliding window correlation (SD-iFC) were computed for regions of interest (ROIs) from default mode and salience networks, as well as amygdala and thalamus. In both studies, ROI pairings with significant underconnectivity (ASD<TD) were identified. Mediation analyses showed that decreased mean iFC in the ASD groups was significantly affected by increased SD-iFC. Our study is the first to identify temporal variability across time as a significant contributing factor to the common finding of static underconnectivity in ASD. Since peak connectivity across time was not significantly reduced in ASD, static underconnectivity findings may have to be reinterpreted, suggesting that connections are not actually \"broken\" in ASD, but subject to greater intra-individual variability across time. Our findings indicate the need for dynamic approaches to iFC in clinical functional connectivity MRI (fcMRI) investigations. Copyright © 2016 Mary Ann Liebert, Inc.},\n",

      "abstract={When exposed to self-face images, individuals often experience embarrassment, which is enhanced by being observed. This self-evaluative emotion is related to activity in the right anterior insula and the functional connectivity between the anterior cingulate and prefrontal cortices. Coupling between cognitive evaluation of self-face images and emotional response to them (cognitive-emotional coupling) is weaker in individuals with autism spectrum disorder (ASD), in parallel with reduced activity of the right insula. To determine whether self-evaluative emotions of individuals with ASD are less strongly impacted by observation, we conducted functional MRI in 14 adult men with ASD and 18 age-matched control men while the participants viewed self-face images. Increased embarrassment upon observation was positively correlated with increased activity in the right anterior insula in the control group, but not in the ASD group. In addition, awareness of being observed enhanced cognitive-emotional coupling in the controls but not in the ASD group. The coupling was correlated with the functional connectivity between the anterior cingulate and medial prefrontal cortices. These results suggest that the reduced impact of observation on embarrassment induced by self-face images in individuals with ASD is related to impairment in the right anterior insula, which is involved in creating subjective feelings, and the anterior cingulate cortex, which acts as a hub for integrating information from others during self-face evaluation.},\n",

      "abstract={The human voice is a critical social cue, and listeners are extremely sensitive to the voices in their environment. One of the most salient voices in a child's life is mother's voice: Infants discriminate their mother's voice from the first days of life, and this stimulus is associated with guiding emotional and social function during development. Little is known regarding the functional circuits that are selectively engaged in children by biologically salient voices such as mother's voice or whether this brain activity is related to children's social communication abilities. We used functional MRI to measure brain activity in 24 healthy children (mean age, 10.2 y) while they attended to brief (<1 s) nonsense words produced by their biological mother and two female control voices and explored relationships between speech-evoked neural activity and social function. Compared to female control voices, mother's voice elicited greater activity in primary auditory regions in the midbrain and cortex; voice-selective superior temporal sulcus (STS); the amygdala, which is crucial for processing of affect; nucleus accumbens and orbitofrontal cortex of the reward circuit; anterior insula and cingulate of the salience network; and a subregion of fusiform gyrus associated with face perception. The strength of brain connectivity between voice-selective STS and reward, affective, salience, memory, and face-processing regions during mother's voice perception predicted social communication skills. Our findings provide a novel neurobiological template for investigation of typical social development as well as clinical disorders, such as autism, in which perception of biologically and socially salient voices may be impaired.},\n",

      "abstract={Autism spectrum disorder is a kind of mental disease which involves the disorders of the perception, emotion, memory, language, intelligence, thinking, action, etc. The aim of this paper is to investigate the brain activity characteristics of the children with autism during complex environments by analyzing electroencephalogram (EEG) signals from the neuroergonomics perspective. The virtual driving environment as a complex multi-task source is used to organically connect brain systems with human motion control. The 14-channel EEG signals are obtained including the EEG baseline signals on a resting state (about 3 min) and the EEG activity signals during driving (about 5 min). The method of the shift average sample entropy is proposed to deal with EEG signals in the resting and the virtual driving environments. Considering the highly complex hyper-dimensional characteristics of EEG signals, the different embedding dimensions (such as 2 and 6 dimensions) are analyzed in the sample entropy estimation. The results show that the average sample entropy values of autism spectrum disorder (ASD) subjects are lower than those of healthy subjects during resting and driving, respectively, especially in the prefrontal lobe, temporal lobe, parietal lobe and occipital lobe during resting and in temporal lobe and occipital lobe during driving. It indicates that ASD children lack the ability to adapt easily their behaviors. Meanwhile, like healthy subjects, the average sample entropy values of ASD subjects during driving are higher than those during resting as a whole. Moreover, the EEG activity signals of ASD are obviously higher than the EEG baseline signals in prefrontal lobe, frontal lobe, frontal central lobe and temporal lobe regions in 95% significant level. And for healthy subjects, the activity signals are significantly higher than the baseline signals only in parietal lobe region. Furthermore, the brain activities of ASD subjects during driving come closer to those of healthy subjects during resting. It suggests that the virtual driving environment may be helpful for the treatment of ASD individuals. In addition, the ASD and healthy subjects have a certain right hemisphere dominance in the whole region except in the parietal lobe region. In the parietal lobe region, they have some left hemisphere dominance, especially during driving. And for ASD subjects, there is the significant right hemisphere dominance in the temporal lobe in 95% confidence level no matter whether in the resting state or in the driving state. The results show that it is suitable for the shift average sample entropy analysis to study the brain activities of ASD individuals. This study will provide a new research method for the further research on the mechanism of autism and its diagnosis, evaluation and intervention. ï¿½ 2016 Chinese Physical Society.},\n",

      "abstract={Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is associated with disruption of local-and long-range functional connectivity (FC). The direction of those changes in FC (increase or decrease), however, is inconsistent across studies. Further, age-dependent changes of distance-specific FC in ASD remain unclear. In this study, we used resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging data from sixty-four typical controls (TC) and sixty-four patients with ASD, whom we further classified into child (<11 years), adolescent (11-18 years) and adult cohorts (>18 years). Functional connectivity (FC) analysis was conducted at voxel level. We employed a three-way analysis of covariance on FC to conduct statistical analyses. Results revealed that patients with ASD had lower FC than TC in cerebellum, fusiform gyrus, inferior occipital gyrus and posterior inferior temporal gyrus. Significant diagnosis-by-distance interaction was observed in ASD patients with reduced short-range and long-range FC in posterior cingulate cortex and medial prefrontal cortex. Importantly, we found significant diagnosis-by-Age-by-distance interaction in orbitofrontal cortex with short-range FC being lower in autistic children, but-To a less extent-higher in autistic adults. Our findings suggest a major role of connection length in development changes of FC in ASD. We hope our study will facilitate deeper understanding of the neural mechanisms underlying ASD.},\n",

      "abstract={The relationship between unusual sensory features (hyper-reactivity, hypo-reactivity, and unusual sensory interests) and the parasympathetic nervous system in autism spectrum disorder (ASD) has recently garnered interest. The purpose of this study was to investigate whether unusual sensory features are associated with resting-state cardiac vagus nerve activity in ASD children. Electrocardiogram signals were recorded during three 2-min resting periods to quantify the high frequency (HF) component of heart rate variability (HRV) in 37 children with ASD aged 6-12 and 32 typically developing children. Parent-reported questionnaires (Short Sensory Profile, SSP; Social Responsiveness Scale-2, SRS-2) assessed atypical sensory behaviors in daily life and autistic traits. Children with ASD consistently showed lower HF-HRV than typically developing children across the three resting periods. The SSP \"Visual/Auditory Sensitivity\" score was correlated with resting-state HF-HRV in the ASD group, indicating that ASD children with more severe visual/auditory hyper-reactivity in daily life have lower vagus nerve activity. The SRS-2 \"Restricted Interests and Repetitive Behavior\" score was also correlated with resting-state HF-HRV in the ASD group. These findings suggest that ASD children with lower vagus nerve activity may have inadequate self-regulatory capacity and difficulty regulating behavioral responses to unpredictable and unavoidable visual/auditory stimuli in daily life. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

This study investigated the structural and functional correlates of autistic traits measured using the Social Responsiveness Scale (SRS) in neurotypical adolescents. Twenty-six neurotypical male adolescents (12-18 years old) were recruited for this study and underwent structural and resting functional magnetic resonance image scanning, and intelligence quotient and SRS evaluations. We used the automated surface-based method (FreeSurfer) to measure cortical thickness and seed-based functional connectivity (FC) analysis to derive the FC map of the dorsal anterior cingulate (dACC). Brain-wise regression analyses of cortical thickness and FC maps on SRS scores were performed using a general linear model. The results indicated that higher autistic trait ratings of total SRS scores were associated with a thinner cortex in the left insula, right insula, and right superior temporal gyrus. Furthermore, we observed that only higher scores of social awareness were correlated with increased FC between the dACC and right superior temporal gyrus and decreased FC between the dACC and right putamen and thalamus. These results indicated that a quantitative trait in social cognition is associated with structural and connectivity variations linked to ASD patients. © 2015 International Society for Autism Research, Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},\n",

The growing speed at which massive genetic data are produced causes serious lags in analysis and interpretation of the data. Thus, there is a need to develop systematic genetic data mining processes that facilitate efficient analysis of large datasets. We report a new genetic data mining system, ProcessGeneLists and integrated a list of ASD-related genes with currently available resources in gene expression and functional connectivity of the human brain. Our data-mining program successfully identified three primary regions of interest (ROIs) in the mouse brain: inferior colliculus, ventral posterior complex of the thalamus (VPC), and parafascicular nucleus (PFn). To understand its pathogenic relevance in ASD, we examined the resting state functional connectivity (RSFC) of the homologous ROIs in human brain with other brain regions that were previously implicated in the neuro-psychiatric features of ASD. Among them, the RSFC of the VPC with the medial frontal gyrus (MFG) was significantly more anticorrelated, whereas the RSFC of the PN with the globus pallidus was significantly increased in children with ASD compared with healthy children. Moreover, greater values of RSFC between VPC and MFG were correlated with severity index and repetitive behaviors in children with ASD. No significant RSFC differences were detected in adults with ASD. Together, these data demonstrate the utility of our data-mining program through identifying the aberrant connectivity of thalamo-cortical circuits in children with ASD. © 2015 International Society for Autism Research, Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},\n",

      "abstract={Background Animal and human studies highlight the role of oxytocin in social cognition and behavior and the potential of intranasal oxytocin (IN-OT) to treat social impairment in individuals with neuropsychiatric disorders such as autism. However, extensive efforts to evaluate the central actions and therapeutic efficacy of IN-OT may be marred by the absence of data regarding its temporal dynamics and sites of action in the living human brain. Methods In a placebo-controlled study, we used arterial spin labeling to measure IN-OT-induced changes in resting regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) in 32 healthy men. Volunteers were blinded regarding the nature of the compound they received. The rCBF data were acquired 15 min before and up to 78 min after onset of treatment onset (40 IU of IN-OT or placebo). The data were analyzed using mass univariate and multivariate pattern recognition techniques. Results We obtained robust evidence delineating an oxytocinergic network comprising regions expected to express oxytocin receptors, based on histologic evidence, and including core regions of the brain circuitry underpinning social cognition and emotion processing. Pattern recognition on rCBF maps indicated that IN-OT-induced changes were sustained over the entire posttreatment observation interval (25-78 min) and consistent with a pharmacodynamic profile showing a peak response at 39-51 min. Conclusions Our study provides the first visualization and quantification of IN-OT-induced changes in rCBF in the living human brain unaffected by cognitive, affective, or social manipulations. Our findings can inform theoretical and mechanistic models regarding IN-OT effects on typical and atypical social behavior and guide future experiments (e.g., regarding the timing of experimental manipulations). © 2016 The Authors.},\n",

      "abstract={The ‘default-mode’ network (DMN) has been investigated in the presence of various disorders, such as Alzheimer’s disease and Autism spectrum disorders. More recently, this investigation has expanded to include patients with ischemic injury. Here, we characterized the effects of ischemic injury in terms of its spectral distribution of resting-state low-frequency oscillations and further investigated whether those specific disruptions were unique to the DMN, or rather more general, affecting the global cortical system. With 43 young healthy adults, 42 older healthy adults, 14 stroke patients in their early stage (<7 days after stroke onset), and 16 stroke patients in their later stage (between 1 to 6 months after stroke onset), this study showed that patterns of cortical system disruption may differ between healthy aging and following the event of an ischemic stroke. The stroke group in the later stage demonstrated a global reduction in the amplitude of the slow-5 oscillations (0.01-0.027 Hz) in the DMN as well as in the primary visual and sensorimotor networks, two ‘task-positive’ networks. In comparison to the young healthy group, the older healthy subjects presented a decrease in the amplitude of the slow-5 oscillations specific to the components of the DMN, while exhibiting an increase in oscillation power in the task-positive networks. These two processes of a decrease DMN and an increase in ‘task-positive’ slow-5 oscillations may potentially be related, with a deficit in DMN inhibition, leading to an elevation of oscillations in non-DMN systems. These findings also suggest that disruptions of the slow-5 oscillations in healthy aging may be more specific to the DMN while the disruptions of those oscillations following a stroke through remote (diaschisis) effects may be more widespread, highlighting a non-specificity of disruption on the DMN in stroke population. The mechanisms underlying those differing modes of network disruption need to be further explored to better inform our understanding of brain function in healthy individuals and following injury. © 2016 La, Mossahebi, Nair, Young, Stamm, Birn, Meyerand and Prabhakaran.},\n",

      "abstract={Many complex brain disorders, such as autism spectrum disorders, exhibit a wide range of symptoms and disability. To understand how brain communication is impaired in such conditions, functional connectivity studies seek to understand individual differences in brain network structure in terms of covariates that measure symptom severity. In practice, however, functional connectivity is not observed but estimated from complex and noisy neural activity measurements. Imperfect subject network estimates can compromise subsequent efforts to detect covariate effects on network structure. We address this problem in the case of Gaussian graphical models of functional connectivity, by proposing novel two-level models that treat both subject level networks and population level covariate effects as unknown parameters. To account for imperfectly estimated subject level networks when fitting these models, we propose two related approaches-R2 based on resampling and random effects test statistics, and R3 that additionally employs random adaptive penalization. Simulation studies using realistic graph structures reveal that R2 and R3 have superior statistical power to detect covariate effects compared to existing approaches, particularly when the number of within subject observations is comparable to the size of subject networks. Using our novel models and methods to study parts of the ABIDE dataset, we find evidence of hypoconnectivity associated with symptom severity in autism spectrum disorders, in frontoparietal and limbic systems as well as in anterior and posterior cingulate cortices. © 2016 Narayan and Allen.},\n",

This work focuses on analyzing the brain activation for autistic subjects, measured by fMRI during rest, relative to the control group using interhemispherical analysis. Though both groups activated similarly in cortical areas, indications of under connectivity were exhibited by the autistic group measured by Granger Causality and Conditional Granger Causality. Results show that as connectivity decreases, GC and CGC values also get decreased. The left hemisphere exhibits depreciation in the connectivity in comparison to that of right hemisphere for the autistic individuals whose GC and CGC values keeps decreasing in the left hemisphere seed regions.

      "abstract={Epilepsy and autistic spectrum disorder frequently coexist in the same individual. Electroencephalogram (EEG) epileptiform activity is also present at a substantially higher rate in children with autism than normally developing children. As with epilepsy, there are a multitude of genetic and environmental factors that can result in autistic spectrum disorder. There is growing consensus from both animal and clinical studies that autism is a disorder of aberrant connectivity. As measured with functional magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and EEG, the brain in autistic spectrum disorder may be under- or overconnected or have a mixture of over- and underconnectivity. In the case of comorbid epilepsy and autism, an imbalance of the excitatory/inhibitory (E/I) ratio in selected regions of the brain may drive overconnectivity. Understanding the mechanism by which altered connectivity in individuals with comorbid epilepsy and autistic spectrum disorder results in the behaviors specific to the autistic spectrum disorder remains a challenge. © 2016 Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press; All rights reserved.},\n",

Across conditions, adolescents with ASD showed reduced right hemisphere temporal–central alpha coherence compared to typically developing adolescents. Greater right temporal–central alpha coherence during joint attention was positively associated with social cognitive performance in typical development but not in ASD.

      "abstract={Fragile X Syndrome (FXS) is the most common heritable single gene cause of autism spectrum disorder (ASD). FMR1-KO mice mimic the etiology and phenotypic manifestations of FXS. Neuroanatomical changes in specific brain regions have been reported in clinical settings and in preclinical models. FMR1-KO mice have been generated in different strains including C57Bl/6 (B6) and FVB. Mice on different genetic backgrounds have stable yet distinct behavioral phenotypes that may lead to unique gene-strain interactions on brain structure. Previous magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) studies have examined FMR1 knockout male mice on a B6 and found few differences compared to wild-type mice. Here, we examine brain volumes in FMR1 knockout male mice on a FVB background using high resolution (multi-channel 7.0. Tesla) MRI. We observe multiple differences in the neuroanatomy of male FMR1-/. y mice on a FVB background. Significantly larger relative volume (% total brain volume) differences were found in major white matter structures throughout the brain. In addition, there were changes in areas associated with fronto-striatal circuitry and other regions. Functional and structural connectivity differences are often seen in human ASD, and therefore, this increased white matter seen in the FMR1-KO-FVB could be highlighting a structural over-connectivity, which could lead to some of the behavioral abnormalities seen with the FMR1-KO-FVB mice. Furthermore, these results highlight the importance of genetic strain contribution to brain structure. © 2016 IBRO.},\n",

      "abstract={Several neuroimaging studies support the model of abnormal development of brain connectivity in patients with autismspectrum disorders (ASD). In this study, we aimed to test the hypothesis of reduced functional network segregation in autistic patients compared with controls. Methods: Functional MRI data from children acquired under a resting-state protocol (Autism Brain Imaging Data Exchange [ABIDE]) were submitted to both fuzzy spectral clustering (FSC) with entropy analysis and graph modularity analysis. Results: We included data from 814 children in our analysis. We identified 5 regions of interest comprising the motor, temporal and occipitotemporal cortices with increased entropy (p < 0.05) in the clustering structure (i.e., more segregation in the controls). Moreover, we noticed a statistically reduced modularity (p < 0.001) in the autistic patients compared with the controls. Significantly reduced eigenvector centrality values (p < 0.05) in the patients were observed in the same regions that were identified in the FSC analysis. Limitations: There is considerable heterogeneity in the fMRI acquisition protocols among the sites that contributed to the ABIDE data set (e.g., scanner type, pulse sequence, duration of scan and resting-state protocol). Moreover, the sites differed in many variables related to sample characterization (e.g., age, IQ and ASD diagnostic criteria). Therefore, we cannot rule out the possibility that additional differences in functional network organization would be found in a more homogeneous data sample of individuals with ASD. Conclusion: Our results suggest that the organization of the whole-brain functional network in patients with ASD is different from that observed in controls, which implies a reduced modularity of the brain functional networks involved in sensorimotor, social, affective and cognitive processing. © 2016 8872147 Canada Inc.},\n",

      "abstract={Introduction: Resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (R-fMRI) is dynamic in nature as neural activities constantly change over the time and are dominated by repeating brief activations and deactivations involving many brain regions. Each region participates in multiple brain functions and is part of various functionally distinct but spatially overlapping networks. Functional connectivity computed as correlations over the entire time series always overlooks interregion interactions that often occur repeatedly and dynamically in time, limiting its application to disease diagnosis. Aims: We develop a novel framework that uses short-time activation patterns of brain connectivity to better detect subtle disease-induced disruptions of brain connectivity. A clustering algorithm is first used to temporally decompose R-fMRI time series into distinct clusters with similar spatial distribution of neural activity based on the assumption that functionally distinct networks should be largely temporally distinct as brain states do not simultaneously coexist in general. A Pearson correlation-based functional connectivity network is then constructed for each cluster to allow for better exploration of spatiotemporal dynamics of individual neural activity. To reduce significant intersubject variability and to remove possible spurious connections, we use a group-constrained sparse regression model to construct a backbone sparse network for each cluster and use it to weight the corresponding Pearson correlation network. Results: The proposed method outperforms the conventional static, temporally dependent fully connected correlation-based networks by at least 7% on a publicly available autism dataset. We were able to reproduce similar results using data from other centers. Conclusions: By combining the advantages of temporal independence and group-constrained sparse regression, our method improves autism diagnosis. © 2016 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.},\n",

      "abstract={Previous functional connectivity studies have found both hypo- and hyper-connectivity in brains of individuals having autism spectrum disorder (ASD). Here we studied abnormalities in functional brain subnetworks in high-functioning individuals with ASD during free viewing of a movie containing social cues and interactions. Twenty-six subjects (13 with ASD) watched a 68-min movie during functional magnetic resonance imaging. For each subject, we computed Pearson's correlation between haemodynamic time-courses of each pair of 6-mm isotropic voxels. From the whole-brain functional networks, we derived individual and group-level subnetworks using graph theory. Scaled inclusivity was then calculated between all subject pairs to estimate intersubject similarity of connectivity structure of each subnetwork. Additional 54 individuals (27 with ASD) from the ABIDE resting-state database were included to test the reproducibility of the results. Between-group differences were observed in the composition of default-mode and ventro-temporal-limbic (VTL) subnetworks. The VTL subnetwork included amygdala, striatum, thalamus, parahippocampal, fusiform, and inferior temporal gyri. Further, VTL subnetwork similarity between subject pairs correlated significantly with similarity of symptom gravity measured with autism quotient. This correlation was observed also within the controls, and in the reproducibility dataset with ADI-R and ADOS scores. Our results highlight how the reorganization of functional subnetworks in individuals with ASD clarifies the mixture of hypo- and hyper-connectivity findings. Importantly, only the functional organization of the VTL subnetwork emerges as a marker of inter-individual similarities that co-vary with behavioral measures across all participants. These findings suggest a pivotal role of ventro-temporal and limbic systems in autism. Hum Brain Mapp 37:1066-1079, 2016. © 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},\n",

      "abstract={Agenesis of the corpus callosum (AgCC) is a congenital condition associated with wide-ranging emotional and social impairments often overlapping with the diagnostic criteria for autism. Mapping functional connectivity in the acallosal brain can help identify neural correlates of the deficits associated with this condition, and elucidate how congenital white matter alterations shape the topology of large-scale functional networks. By using resting-state BOLD functional magnetic resonance imaging (rsfMRI), here we show that acallosal BTBR T+tpr3tf/J (BTBR) mice, an idiopathic model of autism, exhibit impaired intra-hemispheric connectivity in fronto-cortical, but not in posterior sensory cortical areas. We also document profoundly altered subcortical and intra-hemispheric connectivity networks, with evidence of marked fronto-thalamic and striatal disconnectivity, along with aberrant spatial extension and strength of ipsilateral and local connectivity. Importantly, inter-hemispheric tracing of monosynaptic connections in the primary visual cortex using recombinant rabies virus confirmed the absence of direct homotopic pathways between posterior cortical areas of BTBR mice, suggesting a polysynaptic origin for the synchronous rsfMRI signal observed in these regions. Collectively, the observed long-range connectivity impairments recapitulate hallmark neuroimaging findings in autism, and are consistent with the behavioral phenotype of BTBR mice. In contrast to recent rsfMRI studies in high functioning AgCC individuals, the profound fronto-cortical and subcortical disconnectivity mapped suggest that compensatory mechanism may not necessarily restore the full connectional topology of the brain, resulting in residual connectivity alterations that serve as plausible substrates for the cognitive and emotional deficits often associated with AgCC. © 2014, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.},\n",

Here, we use two visual oddball tasks to investigate brain systems engaged during attention to social (face) and non-social (scene) stimuli. We focused on the dorsal and ventral subdivisions of the anterior insula (dAI and vAI, respectively), anatomically distinct regions contributing to a 'salience network' that is known to regulate attention to behaviorally meaningful stimuli. Children with ASD performed comparably to their typically developing (TD) peers, but they engaged the right dAI and vAI differently in response to deviant faces compared with deviant scenes. Multivariate activation patterns in the dAI reliably discriminated between children with ASD and TD children with 85% classification accuracy, and children with ASD activated the vAI more than their TD peers. Children with ASD and their TD peers also differed in dAI connectivity patterns to deviant faces, with stronger within-salience network interactions in the ASD group and stronger cross-network interactions in the TD group. Our findings point to atypical patterns of right anterior insula activation and connectivity in ASD and suggest that multiple functions subserved by the insula, including attention and affective processing of salient social stimuli, are aberrant in children with the disorder. © The Author (2015).

      "abstract={Neurological soft signs (NSS) are frequently found in psychiatric disorders of significant neurodevelopmental origin, e.g., in patients with schizophrenia and autism. Yet NSS are also present in healthy individuals suggesting a neurodevelopmental signature of motor function, probably as a continuum between health and disease. So far, little is known about the neural mechanisms underlying these motor phenomena in healthy persons, and it is even less known whether the cerebellum contributes to NSS expression. Thirty-seven healthy young adults (mean age = 23 years) were studied using high-resolution structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and “resting-state” functional MRI at three Tesla. NSS levels were measured using the “Heidelberg Scale.” Cerebellar gray matter volume was investigated using cerebellum-optimized voxel-based analysis methods. Cerebellar function was assessed using regional homogeneity (ReHo), a measure of local network strength. The relationship between cerebellar structure and function and NSS was analyzed using regression models. There was no significant relationship between cerebellar volume and NSS (p < 0.005, uncorrected for height, p < 0.05 corrected for spatial extent). Positive associations with cerebellar lobule VI activity were found for the “motor coordination” and “hard signs” NSS domains. A negative relationship was found between lobule VI activity and “complex motor task” domain (p < 0.005, uncorrected for height, p < 0.05 corrected for spatial extent). The data indicate that in healthy young adults, distinct NSS domains are related to cerebellar activity, specifically with activity of cerebellar subregions with known cortical somatomotor projections. In contrast, cerebellar volume is not predictive of NSS in healthy persons. © 2015, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.},\n",

This usually is linked to respiratory dysrhythmia which has been documented in some children with ASD. Objectives: This study evaluated the cardiorespiratory functions in ASD to elucidate the physiologic basis of behaviors. Methods: Nineteen children with ASD and 18 age matched controls underwent autonomic function monitoring at a defined resting state using the NeuroScope. The non-invasive real time beat-to-beat blood pressure was measured by Portapres and fed into the NeuroScope where heart rate, cardiac vagal tone and cardiac sensitivity to baroreceptor were derived from the EKG and blood pressure waveforms using the Vagosoft software; and respiratory rate and rhythm were measured simultaneously by plethysmograph. Respiration was analyzed breath by breath using our prior published methods. Results: Various respiratory dysrhythmias, particularly Biot's and Cheyne-Stokes respiration, were detected in children with ASD, who also exhibited greater variability in respiratory rhythm and amplitudes than controls. The respiratory dysrhythmia in children with ASD was associated with a lower cardiac vagal activity. Conclusion: The Biot's breathing and Cheyne-Stokes respiration coupled with cardiac vagal hypofunction in ASD suggest a brainstem dysfunction consistent with our previous findings. The low parasympathetic activity could explain in part the chronic sensory hyperarousal state in children with ASD. © 2015 Published by Elsevier B.V.},\n",

However, the neurobiological basis of this hypothesis is underspecified because it is unknown whether ASD relates to abnormalities of the amygdaloid input or output nuclei. Here, we investigated the functional connectivity of the amygdaloid social-perceptual input nuclei and emotion-regulation output nuclei in ASD versus controls. Methods: We collected resting state functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data, tailored to provide optimal sensitivity in the amygdala as well as the neocortex, in 20 adolescents and young adults with ASD and 25 matched controls. We performed a regular correlation analysis between the entire amygdala (EA) and the whole brain and used a partial correlation analysis to investigate whole-brain functional connectivity uniquely related to each of the amygdaloid subregions. Results: Between-group comparison of regular EA correlations showed significantly reduced connectivity in visuospatial and superior parietal areas in ASD compared to controls. Partial correlation analysis revealed that this effect was driven by the left superficial and right laterobasal input subregions, but not the centromedial output nuclei. Conclusions: These results indicate reduced connectivity of specifically the amygdaloid sensory input channels in ASD, suggesting that abnormal amygdalo-cortical connectivity can be traced down to the socio-perceptual pathways. © 2016 Rausch et al.},\n",

      "abstract={Neuroimaging studies have shown evidence of disrupted neural adaptation during learning in individuals with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) in several types of tasks, potentially stemming from frontal-posterior cortical underconnectivity (Schipul et al., 2012). The aim of the current study was to examine neural adaptations in an implicit learning task that entails participation of frontal and posterior regions. Sixteen high-functioning adults with ASD and sixteen neurotypical control participants were trained on and performed an implicit dot pattern prototype learning task in a functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) session. During the preliminary exposure to the type of implicit prototype learning task later to be used in the scanner, the ASD participants took longer than the neurotypical group to learn the task, demonstrating altered implicit learning in ASD. After equating task structure learning, the two groups' brain activation differed during their learning of a new prototype in the subsequent scanning session. The main findings indicated that neural adaptations in a distributed task network were reduced in the ASD group, relative to the neurotypical group, and were related to ASD symptom severity. Functional connectivity was reduced and did not change as much during learning for the ASD group, and was related to ASD symptom severity. These findings suggest that individuals with ASD show altered neural adaptations during learning, as seen in both activation and functional connectivity measures. This finding suggests why many real-world implicit learning situations may pose special challenges for ASD. © 2015 Elsevier Inc.},\n",

      "abstract={Background: Resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging studies examining low frequency fluctuations (0.01-0.08. Hz) have revealed atypical whole brain functional connectivity patterns in adolescents with autism spectrum disorder (ASD), and these atypical patterns can be used to discriminate individuals with ASD from controls. However, at present it is unknown whether functional connectivity at specific frequency bands can be used to discriminate individuals with ASD from controls, and whether relationships with symptom severity are stronger in specific frequency bands. Methods: We selected 240 adolescent subjects (12-18. years old, 112 with autism spectrum disorder (101/11, males/females) and 128 healthy controls (104/24, males/females)) from 6 separate international sites in the Autism Brain Imaging Data Exchange database. Whole brain functional connectivity networks were constructed in the Slow-5 (0.01-0.027. Hz) and Slow-4 (0.027-0.073. Hz) frequency bands, which were then used as classification features. Results: An accuracy of 79.17% (p. <. 0.001) was obtained using support vector machine. Most of the discriminative features were concentrated on the Slow-4 band. In the Slow-4 band, atypical connections between the default mode network, fronto-parietal network and cingulo-opercular network were detected. A significant correlation was found between social and communication deficits as measured by the ADOS in individuals with ASD and the classification scores based on connectivity between the default mode network and the cingulo-opercular network. Connections of the thalamus were of the highest classification weight in the Slow-4 band. Conclusions: Our findings provide preliminary evidence for frequency-specific whole brain functional connectivity indices that may eventually be used to aid detection of ASD. © 2015 Elsevier Inc.},\n",

      "abstract={Autism spectrum disorders (ASD) are far more prevalent in males than in females. Little is known however about the differential neural expression of ASD in males and females.We used a resting-state fMRI-dataset comprising 42 males/ 42 females with ASD and 75 male/75 female typical-controls to examine whether autism-related alterations in intrinsic functional connectivity are similar or different in males and females, and particularly whether alterations reflect 'neural masculinization', as predicted by the Extreme Male Brain theory. Males and females showed a differential neural expression of ASD, characterized by highly consistent patterns of hypo-connectivity in males with ASD (compared to typical males), and hyper-connectivity in females with ASD (compared to typical females). Interestingly, patterns of hyper-connectivity in females with ASD reflected a shift towards the (high) connectivity levels seen in typical males (neural masculinization), whereas patterns of hypo-connectivity observed in males with ASD reflected a shift towards the (low) typical feminine connectivity patterns (neural feminization). Our data support the notion that ASD is a disorder of sexual differentiation rather than a disorder characterized by masculinization in both genders. Future work is needed to identify underlying factors such as sex hormonal alterations that drive these sex-specific neural expressions of ASD. © The Author (2016).},\n",

      "abstract={Understanding the organizational architecture of human brain function and its alteration patterns in diseased brains such as Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) patients are of great interests. In-vivo functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) offers a unique window to investigate the mechanism of brain function and to identify functional network components of the human brain. Previously, we have shown that multiple concurrent functional networks can be derived from fMRI signals using whole-brain sparse representation. Yet it is still an open question to derive group-wise consistent networks featured in ASD patients and controls. Here we proposed an effective volumetric network descriptor, named connectivity map, to compactly describe spatial patterns of brain network maps and implemented a fast framework in Apache Spark environment that can effectively identify group-wise consistent networks in big fMRI dataset. Our experiment results identified 144 group-wisely common intrinsic connectivity networks (ICNs) shared between ASD patients and healthy control subjects, where some ICNs are substantially different between the two groups.Moreover, further analysis on the functional connectivity and spatial overlap between these 144 common ICNs reveals connectomics signatures characterizing ASD patients and controls. In particular, the computing time of our Spark-enabled functional connectomics framework is significantly reduced from 240 hours (C++ code, single core) to 20 hours, exhibiting a great potential to handle fMRI big data in the future. © 2016 Published by Elsevier Inc.

      "abstract={The anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) is frequently reported to have functionally distinct sub-regions that play key roles in different intrinsic networks. However, the contribution of the ACC, which is connected to several cortical areas and the limbic system, to autism is not clearly understood, although it may be involved in dysfunctions across several distinct but related functional domains. By comparing resting-state fMRI data from persons with autism and healthy controls, we sought to identify the abnormalities in the functional connectivity (FC) of ACC sub-regions in autism. The analyses found autism-related reductions in FC between the left caudal ACC and the right rolandic operculum, insula, postcentral gyrus, superior temporal gyrus, and the middle temporal gyrus. The FC (z-scores) between the left caudal ACC and the right insula was negatively correlated with the Stereotyped Behaviors and Restricted Interests scores of the autism group. These findings suggest that the caudal ACC is recruited selectively in the pathomechanism of autism.},\n",

      "abstract={There is a general consensus that autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is accompanied by alterations in brain connectivity. Much of the neuroimaging work has focused on assessing long-range connectivity disruptions in ASD. However, evidence from both animal models and postmortem examination of the human brain suggests that local connections may also be disrupted in individuals with the disorder. Here, we investigated how regional homogeneity (ReHo), a measure of similarity of a voxel's timeseries to its nearest neighbors, varies across age in individuals with ASD and typically developing (TD) individuals using a cross-sectional design. Resting-state fMRI data obtained from a publicly available database were analyzed to determine group differences in ReHo between three age cohorts: children, adolescents, and adults. In typical development, ReHo across the entire brain was higher in children than in adolescents and adults. In contrast, children with ASD exhibited marginally lower ReHo than TD children, while adolescents and adults with ASD exhibited similar levels of local connectivity as age-matched neurotypical individuals. During all developmental stages, individuals with ASD exhibited lower local connectivity in sensory processing brain regions and higher local connectivity in complex information processing regions. Further, higher local connectivity in ASD corresponded to more severe ASD symptomatology. These results demonstrate that local connectivity is disrupted in ASD across development, with the most pronounced differences occurring in childhood. Developmental changes in ReHo do not mirror findings from fMRI studies of long-range connectivity in ASD, pointing to a need for more nuanced accounts of brain connectivity alterations in the disorder. © 2015 International Society for Autism Research, Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},\n",

      "abstract={Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) has consistently highlighted impaired or aberrant functional connectivity across brain regions of autism spectrum disorder (ASD) patients. However, the manifestation and neural substrates of these alterations are highly heterogeneous and often conflicting. Moreover, their neurobiological underpinnings and etiopathological significance remain largely unknown. A deeper understanding of the complex pathophysiological cascade leading to aberrant connectivity in ASD can greatly benefit from the use of model organisms where individual pathophysiological or phenotypic components of ASD can be recreated and investigated via approaches that are either off limits or confounded by clinical heterogeneity. Despite some obvious limitations in reliably modeling the full phenotypic spectrum of a complex developmental disorder like ASD, mouse models have played a central role in advancing our basic mechanistic and molecular understanding of this syndrome. Recent progress in mouse brain connectivity mapping via resting-state fMRI (rsfMRI) offers the opportunity to generate and test mechanistic hypotheses about the elusive origin and significance of connectional aberrations observed in autism. Here we discuss recent progress toward this goal, and illustrate initial examples of how the approach can be employed to establish causal links between ASD-related mutations, developmental processes, and brain connectional architecture. As the spectrum of genetic and pathophysiological components of ASD modeled in the mouse is rapidly expanding, the use of rsfMRI can advance our mechanistic understanding of the origin and significance of the connectional alterations associated with autism, and their heterogeneous expression across patient cohorts. ï¿½ 2016 Liska and Gozzi.},\n",

      "abstract={Background: The insular cortex comprises multiple functionally differentiated sub-regions, each of which has different patterns of connectivity with other brain regions. Such diverse connectivity patterns are thought to underlie a wide range of insular functions, including cognitive, affective, and sensorimotor processing, many of which are abnormal in autism spectrum disorder (ASD). Although past neuroimaging studies of ASD have shown structural and functional abnormalities in the insula, possible alterations in the sub-regional organization of the insula and the functional characteristics of each sub-region have not been examined in the ASD brain. Methods: Resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI) data were acquired from 36 adult males with ASD and 38 matched typically developed (TD) controls. A data-driven clustering analysis was applied to rs-fMRI data of voxels in the left and right insula to automatically group voxels with similar intrinsic connectivity pattern into a cluster. After determining the optimal number of clusters based on information theoretic measures of variation of information and mutual information, functional parcellation patterns in both the left and the right insula were compared between the TD and ASD groups. Furthermore, functional profiles of each sub-region were meta-analytically decoded using Neurosynth and were compared between the groups. Results: We observed notable alterations in the anterior sector of the left insula and the middle ventral sub-region of the right insula in the ASD brain. Meta-analytic decoding revealed that whereas the anterior sector of the left insula contained two functionally differentiated sub-regions for cognitive, sensorimotor, and emotional/affective functions in TD brain, only a single functional cluster for cognitive and sensorimotor functions was identified in the anterior sector in the ASD brain. In the right insula, the middle ventral sub-region, which is primarily specialized for sensory- and auditory-related functions, showed a significant volumetric increase in the ASD brain compared with the TD brain. Conclusions: The results indicate an altered organization of sub-regions in specific parts of the left and right insula of the ASD brain. The alterations in the left and right insula may constitute neural substrates underlying abnormalities in emotional/affective and sensory functions in ASD. © 2016 The Author(s).},\n",

      "abstract={Most psychiatric disorders are associated with subtle alterations in brain function and are subject to large interindividual differences. Typically, the diagnosis of these disorders requires time-consuming behavioral assessments administered by a multidisciplinary team with extensive experience. While the application of Machine Learning classification methods (ML classifiers) to neuroimaging data has the potential to speed and simplify diagnosis of psychiatric disorders, the methods, assumptions, and analytical steps are currently opaque and not accessible to researchers and clinicians outside the field. In this paper, we describe potential classification pipelines for autism spectrum disorder, as an example of a psychiatric disorder. The analyses are based on resting-state fMRI data derived from a multisite data repository (ABIDE). We compare several popular ML classifiers such as support vector machines, neural networks, and regression approaches, among others. In a tutorial style, written to be equally accessible for researchers and clinicians, we explain the rationale of each classification approach, clarify the underlying assumptions, and discuss possible pitfalls and challenges. We also provide the data as well as the MATLAB code we used to achieve our results. We show that out-of-the-box ML classifiers can yield classification accuracies of about 60-70%. Finally, we discuss how classification accuracy can be further improved, and we mention methodological developments that are needed to pave the way for the use of ML classifiers in clinical practice. ï¿½ 2016 Kassraian-Fard, Matthis, Balsters, Maathuis and Wenderoth.},\n",

      "abstract={Deficits in language comprehension have been widely reported in children with autism spectrum disorders (ASD), with behavioral and neuroimaging studies finding increased reliance on visuospatial processing to aid in language comprehension. However, no study to date, has taken advantage of this strength in visuospatial processing to improve language comprehension difficulties in ASD. This study used a translational neuroimaging approach to test the role of a visual imagery-based reading intervention in improving the brain circuitry underlying language processing in children with ASD. Functional magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), in a longitudinal study design, was used to investigate intervention-related change in sentence comprehension, brain activation, and functional connectivity in three groups of participants (age 8-13 years): an experimental group of ASD children (ASD-EXP), a wait-list control group of ASD children (ASD-WLC), and a group of typically developing control children. After intervention, the ASD-EXP group showed significant increase in activity in visual and language areas and right-hemisphere language area homologues, putamen, and thalamus, suggestive of compensatory routes to increase proficiency in reading comprehension. Additionally, ASD children who had the most improvement in reading comprehension after intervention showed greater functional connectivity between left-hemisphere language areas, the middle temporal gyrus and inferior frontal gyrus while reading high imagery sentences. Thus, the findings of this study, which support the principles of dual coding theory [Paivio 2007], suggest the potential of a strength-based reading intervention in changing brain responses and facilitating better reading comprehension in ASD children. © 2015 International Society for Autism Research, Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},\n",

In particular, difficulties with emotional processing in ASD are more pronounced in contexts where emotional expressions are subtle, automatic, and reflexive-that is, implicit. In contrast, explicit emotional processing, which requires the cognitive evaluation of an emotional experience, appears to be relatively intact in individuals with ASD. In the present study, we examined the brain activation and functional connectivity differences underlying explicit and implicit emotional processing in age- and IQ-matched adults with (n = 17) and without (n = 15) ASD. Results indicated: (1) significantly reduced levels of brain activation in participants with ASD in medial prefrontal cortex (MPFC) and superior temporal gyrus (STG) during implicit emotion processing; (2) significantly weaker functional connectivity in the ASD group in connections of the MPFC with the amygdala, temporal lobe, parietal lobe, and fusiform gyrus; (3) No group difference in performance accuracy or reaction time; and (4) Significant positive relationship between empathizing ability and STG activity in ASD but not in typically developing participants.

This study investigated whether resting state functional connectivity, measured by 128-channel EEG oscillation coherence, differs between developmental disorders. Analyses were conducted separately on groups with and without comorbid conditions. Analyses revealed increased coherence across central electrodes over the primary motor cortex and decreased coherence in the frontal lobe networks in those with ASD compared to neurotypical controls. There was increased coherence in occipital lobe networks in the ADHD group compared to other groups. Symptoms of generalised anxiety were positively correlated with both frontal-occipital intrahemispheric (alpha only) coherence and occipital interhemispheric coherence (alpha, approaching theta band). The patterns of coherence in the ASD pure group were different when comorbid conditions were included in the analyses, suggesting that aberrant coherence in the frontal and central areas of the brain is specifically associated with ASD.

Methods: Resting EEG frontal asymmetry (F4-F3) was collected from twelve participants to represent affective responsiveness pre and post a 20-minute treadmill walking exercise at moderate intensity. Results: The association between frontal asymmetry and reported RPE is evident. In addition, the decreased frontal asymmetry from pre-exercise to post-exercise indicates their decreased affect to walking exercise. Conclusions: Resting EEG frontal asymmetry was reflective of affective repsonsivity to exercise in persons with ID. Our finding is not consistent with previous research in the typical population who showed increased frontal brain asymmetry after exercise. The decreased experience of affect pronounced after 20-minute brisk treadmill walking in persons with ID may explain their low motivation to exercise adherence. Therefore, extra motivating factors, such as music or challenging task maybe needed to accomplish exercise and its related benefits in persons with ID. © The British Society for Developmental Disabilities 2016.},\n",

      "abstract={Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a serious neurodevelopmental disorder, associated with autonomic dysregulation. However, the pathomechanism leading to autonomic abnormalities is still unclear. The aim of this study was to assess autonomic nervous system (ANS) activity during baseline in homogenous group of autistic children using electrodermal activity (EDA), as an index of sympathetic activity and short-term heart rate variability (HRV) reflecting predominantly cardiac vagal control. Fifteen ASD boys and 15 healthy age-matched boys at the age of 7-15 years were examined. The continuous EDA and ECG were recorded during resting phase in a supine position. Evaluated parameters: EDA amplitude (μS), rr interval, spectral power, peak frequency and power spectral density in low (LF-HRV: 0.04-0.15 Hz) and high-frequency (HF-HRV: 0.15-0.4 Hz) bands of HRV spectral analysis. In ASD group we found significantly shortened RR intervals (729±20 ms vs. 843±30 ms, p=0.005), lower mean EDA (0.66±0.13 μS vs. 1.66±0.42 μS, p=0.033), reduced spectral activity and power spectral density in HF-HRV compared to controls (2.93±0.12 ms2vs. 3.38±0.10 ms2, p=0.01; 4.12± 0.10 ms2/Hz vs. 4.56±0.11 ms2/Hz, p=0.008, respectively). We suggest that impairment in resting autonomic regulation associated with ASD could represent an important pathomechanism leading to potential cardiovascular complications in ASD. © 2016, Institute of Physiology of the Czech Academy of Sciences, Prague, Czech Republic.},\n",

      "abstract={Although typically identified in early childhood, the social communication symptoms and adaptive behavior deficits that are characteristic of autism spectrum disorder (ASD) persist throughout the lifespan. Despite this persistence, even individuals without cooccurring intellectual disability show substantial heterogeneity in outcomes. Previous studies have found various behavioral assessments [such as intelligence quotient (IQ), early language ability, and baseline autistic traits and adaptive behavior scores] to be predictive of outcome, but most of the variance in functioning remains unexplained by such factors. In this study, we investigated to what extent functional brain connectivity measures obtained from resting-state functional connectivity MRI (rs-fcMRI) could predict the variance left unexplained by age and behavior (follow-up latency and baseline autistic traits and adaptive behavior scores) in two measures of outcomeâ€\" adaptive behaviors and autistic traits at least 1 y postscan (mean follow-up latency = 2 y, 10 mo). We found that connectivity involving the so-called salience network (SN), default-mode network (DMN), and frontoparietal task control network (FPTCN) was highly predictive of future autistic traits and the change in autistic traits and adaptive behavior over the same time period. Furthermore, functional connectivity involving the SN, which is predominantly composed of the anterior insula and the dorsal anterior cingulate, predicted reliable improvement in adaptive behaviors with 100% sensitivity and 70.59% precision. From rs-fcMRI data, our study successfully predicted heterogeneity in outcomes for individuals with ASD that was unaccounted for by simple behavioral metrics and provides unique evidence for networks underlying long-term symptom abatement.},\n",

      "abstract={Objective Converging evidence indicates that brain abnormalities in autism spectrum disorder (ASD) involve atypical network connectivity, but few studies have integrated functional with structural connectivity measures. This multimodal investigation examined functional and structural connectivity of the imitation network in children and adolescents with ASD, and its links with clinical symptoms. Methods Resting state functional magnetic resonance imaging and diffusion-weighted imaging were performed in 35 participants with ASD and 35 typically developing controls, aged 8 to 17 years, matched for age, gender, intelligence quotient, and head motion. Results Within-network analyses revealed overall reduced functional connectivity (FC) between distributed imitation regions in the ASD group. Whole brain analyses showed that underconnectivity in ASD occurred exclusively in regions belonging to the imitation network, whereas overconnectivity was observed between imitation nodes and extraneous regions. Structurally, reduced fractional anisotropy and increased mean diffusivity were found in white matter tracts directly connecting key imitation regions with atypical FC in ASD. These differences in microstructural organization of white matter correlated with weaker FC and greater ASD symptomatology. Interpretation Findings demonstrate atypical connectivity of the brain network supporting imitation in ASD, characterized by a highly specific pattern. This pattern of underconnectivity within, but overconnectivity outside the functional network is in contrast with typical development and suggests reduced network integration and differentiation in ASD. Our findings also indicate that atypical connectivity of the imitation network may contribute to ASD clinical symptoms, highlighting the role of this fundamental social cognition ability in the pathophysiology of ASD. © 2015 The Authors.},\n",

      "abstract={Neurofibromatosis type I (NF1) is a genetic disorder caused by mutations in the neurofibromin 1 gene at locus 17q11.2. Individuals with NF1 have an increased incidence of learning disabilities, attention deficits, and autism spectrum disorders. As a single-gene disorder, NF1 represents a valuable model for understanding gene-brain-behavior relationships. While mouse models have elucidated molecular and cellular mechanisms underlying learning deficits associated with this mutation, little is known about functional brain architecture in human subjects with NF1. To address this question, we used resting state functional connectivity magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fcMRI) to elucidate the intrinsic network structure of 30 NF1 participants compared with 30 healthy demographically matched controls during an eyes-open rs-fcMRI scan. Novel statistical methods were employed to quantify differences in local connectivity (edge strength) and modularity structure, in combination with traditional global graph theory applications. Our findings suggest that individuals with NF1 have reduced anterior-posterior connectivity, weaker bilateral edges, and altered modularity clustering relative to healthy controls. Further, edge strength and modular clustering indices were correlated with IQ and internalizing symptoms. These findings suggest that Ras signaling disruption may lead to abnormal functional brain connectivity; further investigation into the functional consequences of these alterations in both humans and in animal models is warranted. © 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},\n",

      "abstract={Autism spectrum traits exist on a continuum and are more common in males than in females, but the basis for this sex difference is unclear. To this end, the present study draws on the extreme male brain theory, investigating the relationship between sex difference and the default mode network (DMN), both known to be associated with autism spectrum traits. Resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was carried out in 42 females (mean age ± standard deviation, 22.4 ± 4.2 years) and 43 males (mean age ± standard deviation, 23.8 ± 3.9 years) with typical development. Using a combination of different analyses (viz., independent component analysis (ICA), fractional amplitude of low-frequency fluctuation (fALFF), regional homogeneity (ReHo), and seed-based analyses), we examined sex differences in the DMN and the relationship to autism spectrum traits as measured by autism-spectrum quotient (AQ) scores. We found significant differences between female and male subjects in DMN brain regions, with seed-based analysis revealing a significant negative correlation between default-mode resting state functional connectivity of the anterior medial prefrontal cortex seed (aMPFC) and AQ scores in males. However, there were no relationships between DMN sex differences and autism spectrum traits in females. Our findings may provide important insight into the skewed balance of functional connectivity in males compared to females that could serve as a potential biomarker of the degree of autism spectrum traits in line with the extreme male brain theory. © 2015 Jung et al.

      "abstract={Preliminary evidence suggests aberrant (mostly reduced) thalamocortical (TC) connectivity in autism spectrum disorder (ASD), but despite the crucial role of thalamus in sensorimotor functions and its extensive connectivity with cerebral cortex, relevant evidence remains limited. We performed a comprehensive investigation of region-specific TC connectivity in ASD. Resting-state functional MRI and diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) data were acquired for 60 children and adolescents with ASD (ages 7-17 years) and 45 age, sex, and IQ-matched typically developing (TD) participants. We examined intrinsic functional connectivity (iFC) and anatomical connectivity (probabilistic tractography) with thalamus, using 68 unilateral cerebral cortical regions of interest (ROIs). For frontal and parietal lobes, iFC was atypically reduced in the ASD group for supramodal association cortices, but was increased for cingulate gyri and motor cortex. Temporal iFC was characterized by overconnectivity for auditory cortices, but underconnectivity for amygdalae. Occipital iFC was broadly reduced in the ASD group. DTI indices (such as increased radial diffusion) for regions with group differences in iFC further indicated compromised anatomical connectivity, especially for frontal ROIs, in the ASD group. Our findings highlight the regional specificity of aberrant TC connectivity in ASD. Their overall pattern can be largely accounted for by functional overconnectivity with limbic and sensorimotor regions, but underconnectivity with supramodal association cortices. This could be related to comparatively early maturation of limbic and sensorimotor regions in the context of early overgrowth in ASD, at the expense of TC connectivity with later maturing cortical regions. © 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},\n",

      "abstract={Fragile X syndrome (FXS), the most common inherited form of intellectual disability disorder and a frequent cause of autism spectrum disorder (ASD), is characterized by a high prevalence of sensory symptoms. Perturbations in the anatomical connectivity of neocortical circuits resulting in their functional defects have been hypothesized to contribute to the underlying etiology of these disorders. We tested this idea by probing alterations in the functional and structural connectivity of both local and long-ranging neocortical circuits in the Fmr1-/y mouse model of FXS. To achieve this, we combined in vivo ultrahigh-field diffusion tensor magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), functional MRI, and viral tracing approaches in adult mice. Our results show an anatomical hyperconnectivity phenotype for the primary visual cortex (V1), but a disproportional low connectivity of V1 with other neocortical regions. These structural data are supported by defects in the structural integrity of the subcortical white matter in the anterior and posterior forebrain. These anatomical alterations might contribute to the observed functional decoupling across neocortical regions. We therefore identify FXS as a \"connectopathy,\" providing a translational model for understanding sensory processing defects and functional decoupling of neocortical areas in FXS and ASD. © 2015 The Authors.},\n",

Method A total of 21 high-functioning individuals with ASD aged 12 to 18 years, and 23 gender-, IQ-, and age-matched adolescents with typical development (TYP), completed a transitive inference (TI) task implemented using rapid event-related functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). Participants were trained on overlapping pairs in a stimulus hierarchy of colored ovals where A>B>C>D>E>F and then tested on generalizing this training to new stimulus pairings (AF, BD, BE) in a \"Big Game.\" Whole-brain univariate, region of interest, and functional connectivity analyses were used. Results During training, the TYP group exhibited increased recruitment of the prefrontal cortex (PFC), whereas the group with ASD showed greater functional connectivity between the PFC and the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC). Both groups recruited the hippocampus and caudate comparably; however, functional connectivity between these regions was positively associated with TI performance for only the group with ASD. During the Big Game, the TYP group showed greater recruitment of the PFC, parietal cortex, and the ACC. Recruitment of these regions increased with age in the group with ASD. Conclusion During TI, TYP individuals recruited cognitive control-related brain regions implicated in mature problem solving/reasoning including the PFC, parietal cortex, and ACC, whereas the group with ASD showed functional connectivity of the hippocampus and the caudate that was associated with task performance. Failure to reliably engage cognitive control-related brain regions may produce less integrated flexible learning in individuals with ASD unless they are provided with task support that, in essence, provides them with cognitive control; however, this pattern may normalize with age. © 2015 American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry.},\n",

Individuals with autism spectrum disorders (ASD) have been found to have altered ToM skills, which significantly impacts the quality of their social interactions. Neuroimaging studies have reported altered activation of the ToM cortical network, especially in adults with autism, yet little is known about the brain responses underlying ToM in younger individuals with ASD. This functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) study investigated the neural mechanisms underlying ToM in high-functioning children and adolescents with ASD and matched typically developing (TD) peers. Methods: fMRI data were acquired from 13 participants with ASD and 13 TD control participants while they watched animations involving two \"interacting\" geometrical shapes. Results: Participants with ASD showed significantly reduced activation, relative to TD controls, in regions considered part of the ToM network, the mirror network, and the cerebellum. Functional connectivity analyses revealed underconnectivity between frontal and posterior regions during task performance in the ASD participants.

AC was assessed by the DW-MRI technique and FC by EEG coherence calculation, in three experimental conditions: basal, watching a popular cartoon with audio (V-A), and with muted audio track (VwA). For short-range connections, basal records, statistical significant correlations were found for all EEG bands in the left hemisphere, but no significant correlations were found for fast EEG frequencies in the right hemisphere. For the V-A condition, significant correlations were mainly diminished for the left hemisphere; for the right hemisphere, no significant correlations were found for the fast EEG frequency bands. For the VwA condition, significant correlations for the rapid EEG frequencies mainly disappeared for the right hemisphere. For long-range connections, basal records showed similar correlations for both hemispheres. For the right hemisphere, significant correlations incremented to all EEG bands for the V-A condition, but these significant correlations disappeared for the fast EEG frequencies in the VwA condition. It appears that in a resting-state condition, AC is better associated with functional connectivity for short-range connections in the left hemisphere. The V-A experimental condition enriches the AC and FC association for long-range connections in the right hemisphere. This might be related to an effective connectivity improvement due to full video stimulation (visual and auditory). An impaired audiovisual interaction in the right hemisphere might explain why significant correlations disappeared for the fast EEG frequencies in the VwA experimental condition. © Mary Ann Liebert, Inc. 2015.},\n",

      "abstract={Objective Growing evidence indicates that autism spectrum disorder (ASD) stems from abnormal structural and functional connectivity of neural networks. Although diagnostic symptoms are sociocommunicative, motor-related functions (beyond repetitive mannerisms) are also impaired. However, evidence on connectivity at the level of basic motor execution is limited, which we address here. Method We compared right-handed children and adolescents (aged 7-18 years) with ASD (n = 44) to matched typically developing participants (TD, n = 36) using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Diffusion-weighted imaging and probabilistic tractography measured microstructure of the corticospinal tract (CST). Intrinsic functional connectivity MRI examined whole-brain voxelwise correlations, both with identical precentral gyrus (PCG) seeds. Results In the group with ASD, radial and mean diffusivity were increased bilaterally in the CST, particularly in superior segments, and a leftward asymmetry of CST volume detected in the TD group was reversed. Functionally, overconnectivity was found for both left and right PCG with prefrontal, parietal, medial occipital, and cingulate cortices. The group with ASD also showed significantly reduced asymmetry of functional connectivity for both left and right PCG seeds. Finally, in the group with ASD, significant correlations were found for functional overconnectivity of the right PCG seed with anisotropy and mean diffusivity in the right CST. Conclusion The findings, implicating both functional and anatomical connectivity of the primary motor cortex, suggest that network anomalies in ASD go well beyond sociocommunicative domains, affecting basic motor execution. They also suggest that even in right-handed adolescents with ASD, typical left hemisphere dominance is reduced, both anatomically and functionally, with an unusual degree of right hemisphere motor participation. © 2015 American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry.},\n",

      "abstract={The increasing knowledge on early childhood development has resulted in a structured and hierarchical screening measure for Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) children as early as 3 years old. Early screening for a specific condition of ASD known as Asperger’s syndrome (AS), however, is slightly more challenging due to the subjective nature of the detection. This paper proposes a quantitative method for the identification of AS children based on the analysis of EEG signals. Brain signals were obtained from 2 children with AS and 2 typically developing children during resting states (eyes closed and eyes open). Features are extracted using Mel Frequency Cepstal Coefficient (MFCC) and classified using Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) Neural Network. The proposed model yields classification accuracy up to 79%, with EEG features during eyes closed giving higher accuracy compared to eyes open. This indicates the stability of the EEG during eyes closed that is worth investigating for the identification of brain developmental disorder. © 2015 American Scientific Publishers.

      "abstract={Autism spectrum disorders (ASD) are a group of neurodevelopmental conditions characterized by atypical structural and functional brain connectivity. Complex network analysis has been mainly used to describe altered network-level organization for functional systems and white matter tracts in ASD. However, atypical functional and structural connectivity are likely to be also linked to abnormal development of the correlated structure of cortical gray matter. Such covariations of gray matter are particularly well suited to the investigation of the complex cortical pathology of ASD, which is not confined to isolated brain regions but instead acts at the systems level. In this study, we examined network centrality properties of gray matter networks in adults with ASD (n = 84) and neurotypical controls (n = 84) using graph theoretical analysis. We derived a structural covariance network for each group using interregional correlation matrices of cortical volumes extracted from a surface-based parcellation scheme containing 68 cortical regions. Differences between groups in closeness network centrality measures were evaluated using permutation testing. We identified several brain regions in the medial frontal, parietal and temporo-occipital cortices with reductions in closeness centrality in ASD compared to controls. We also found an association between an increased number of autistic traits and reduced centrality of visual nodes in neurotypicals. Our study shows that ASD are accompanied by atypical organization of structural covariance networks by means of a decreased centrality of regions relevant for social and sensorimotor processing. These findings provide further evidence for the altered network-level connectivity model of ASD. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.},\n",

      "abstract={Virtual lesions in the mirror neuron network using inhibitory low-frequency (1Hz) transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) have been employed to understand its spatio-functional properties. However, no studies have examined the influence of neuro-enhancement by using excitatory high-frequency (20Hz) repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (HF-rTMS) on these networks. We used three forms of TMS stimulation (HF-rTMS, single and paired pulse) to investigate whether the mirror neuron system facilitates the motor system during goal-directed action observation relative to inanimate motion (motor resonance), a marker of putative mirror neuron activity. 31 healthy individuals were randomized to receive single-sessions of true or sham HF-rTMS delivered to the left inferior frontal gyrus - a component of the human mirror system. Motor resonance was assessed before and after HF-rTMS using three TMS cortical reactivity paradigms: (a) 120% of resting motor threshold (RMT), (b) stimulus intensity set to evoke motor evoked potential of 1-millivolt amplitude (SI1mV) and (c) a short latency paired pulse paradigm. Two-way RMANOVA showed a significant group (true versus sham) X occasion (pre- and post-HF-rTMS motor resonance) interaction effect for SI1mV [F(df)=6.26 (1, 29), p=0.018] and 120% RMT stimuli [F(df)=7.01 (1, 29), p=0.013] indicating greater enhancement of motor resonance in the true HF-rTMS group than the sham-group. This suggests that HF-rTMS could adaptively modulate properties of the mirror neuron system. This neuro-enhancement effect is a preliminary step that can open translational avenues for novel brain stimulation therapeutics targeting social-cognition deficits in schizophrenia and autism.

      "abstract={Functional pathology of the default mode network is posited to be central to social-cognitive impairment in autism spectrum disorders (ASD). Altered functional connectivity of the default mode network's midline core may be a potential endophenotype for social deficits in ASD. Generalizability from prior studies is limited by inclusion of medicated participants and by methods favoring restricted examination of network function. This study measured resting-state functional connectivity in 22 8-13 year-old non-medicated children with ASD and 22 typically developing controls using seed-based and network segregation functional connectivity methods. Relative to controls the ASD group showed both under- and over-functional connectivity within default mode and non-default mode regions, respectively. ASD symptoms correlated negatively with the connection strength of the default mode midline core - medial prefrontal cortex-posterior cingulate cortex. Network segregation analysis with the participation coefficient showed a higher area under the curve for the ASD group. Our findings demonstrate that the default mode network in ASD shows a pattern of poor segregation with both functional connectivity metrics. This study confirms the potential for the functional connection of the midline core as an endophenotype for social deficits. Poor segregation of the default mode network is consistent with an excitation/inhibition imbalance model of ASD. © 2015 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Inc.},\n",

      "abstract={A spinal cord injury (SCI) is one of the most common neurological disorders. In this paper, we examined the consequences of upper SCI in a male participant on the cerebral blood flow velocity. In particular, transcranial Doppler was used to study these effects through middle cerebral arteries (MCA) during resting-state periods and during cognitive challenges (non-verbal word-generation tasks and geometric-rotation tasks). Signal characteristics were analyzed from raw signals and envelope signals (maximum velocity) in the time domain, the frequency domain and the time–frequency domain. The frequency features highlighted an increase of the peak frequency in L-MCA and R-MCA raw signals, which revealed stronger cerebral blood flow during geometric/verbal processes respectively. This underlined a slight dominance of the right hemisphere during word-generation periods and a slight dominance of the left hemisphere during geometric processes. This finding was confirmed by cross-correlation in the time domain and by the entropy rate in information-theoretic domain. A comparison of our results to other neurological disorders (Alzheimer’s disease, Parkinson’s disease, autism, epilepsy, traumatic brain injury) showed that the SCI had similar effects such as general decreased cerebral blood flow and similar regular hemispheric dominance in a few cases. © 2015, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.},\n",

Here we examined global hypoconnectivity as an endophenotype of autism spectrum conditions (ASCs). We studied well-matched groups of adolescent males with autism, genetically-related siblings of individuals with autism, and typically-developing control participants. We parcellated the brain into 258 regions and used complex-network analysis to detect a robust hypoconnectivity endophenotype in our participant group. We observed that whole-brain functional connectivity was highest in controls, intermediate in siblings, and lowest in ASC, in task and rest conditions. We identified additional, local endophenotype effects in specific networks including the visual processing and default mode networks. Our analyses are the first to show that whole-brain functional hypoconnectivity is an endophenotype of autism in adolescence, and may thus underlie the heritable similarities seen in adolescents with ASC and their relatives. © 2015 The Authors.

Although socio-emotional impairments are a defining feature of autism spectrum disorder (ASD), empirical evidence directly supporting the link between autonomic, cortical, and socio-emotional abnormalities in ASD is still lacking. In this study, we examined autonomic arousal indexed by skin conductance responses (SCR), concurrent cortical responses measured by functional magnetic resonance imaging, and effective brain connectivity estimated by dynamic causal modeling in seventeen unmedicated high-functioning adults with ASD and seventeen matched controls while they performed an empathy-for-pain task. Compared to controls, adults with ASD showed enhanced SCR related to empathetic pain, along with increased neural activity in the anterior insular cortex, although their behavioral empathetic pain discriminability was reduced and overall SCR was decreased. ASD individuals also showed enhanced correlation between SCR and neural activities in the anterior insular cortex. Importantly, significant group differences in effective brain connectivity were limited to greater reduction in the negative intrinsic connectivity of the anterior insular cortex in the ASD group, indicating a failure in attenuating anterior insular responses to empathetic pain. These results suggest that aberrant interoceptive precision, as indexed by abnormalities in autonomic activity and its central representations, may underlie empathy deficits in ASD. © 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},\n",

Some PS-linked disorders involve characteristic social deficits, such as autism spectrum disorders and schizophrenia, but PS also promotes anxiety disorders. We propose the diversity of symptoms following PS arises from perturbations to early brain development. To this end, we characterized the effects of PS on the developmental trajectory of physiology of the amygdala, a late-developing center for socioemotional control. We found that PS dampened socioemotional behavior and reduced amygdala neuron excitability in offspring during infancy (at postnatal days (P)10, 14, 17 and 21), preadolescence (day 28), and adulthood (day 60). PS offspring in infancy produced fewer isolation-induced vocalizations and in adulthood exhibited less anxiety-like behavior and deficits in social interaction. PS neurons had a more hyperpolarized resting membrane potential from infancy to adulthood and produced fewer action potentials. Moreover, adult amygdala neurons from PS animals expressed larger action potential afterhyperpolarizations and H-current relative to controls, further limiting excitability. Our results suggest that PS can suppress socioemotional behavior throughout development and produce age-specific alterations to amygdala physiology. © 2015 American College of Neuropsychopharmacology.

However, it is unknown whether there is psychophysiological overlap and/or a difference in electroencephalogram (EEG) power spectra between ADHD and comorbid ASD and ADHD (ASD + ADHD), on and off stimulant medication. To explore potential differences and overlap, measures of theta and beta power in adolescents diagnosed with ADHD (n = 33) versus adolescents with combined ASD + ADHD (n = 20), categorized by stimulant medication use (57 % of the total sample), were compared. EEG measures were acquired in three conditions: (1) resting state, eyes closed (2) resting state, eyes open and (3) during an oddball task. In addition, performance on the d2 attention test was analyzed. Adolescents with ADHD displayed more absolute theta activity than adolescents with ASD + ADHD during the eyes open and task conditions, independent of stimulant medication use. In addition, only the adolescents with ADHD showed an association between diminished attention test performance and increased theta in the eyes open condition. Results of the current study suggest that although there is behavioral overlap between ADHD characteristics in adolescents with ADHD and adolescents with combined ASD + ADHD, the underlying psychophysiological mechanisms may be different. Adolescents with ASD + ADHD exhibited fewer of the EEG physiological signs usually associated with ADHD, although there was an overlap in attentional problems between the groups. This may indicate that treatments developed for ADHD work differently in some adolescents with ASD + ADHD and adolescents with ADHD only. © 2014, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.},\n",

We examined whether boys with ASD show altered resting-state iFC of the pRTPJ, and whether atypical iFC of the pRTPJ is associated with social deficits in ASD in a sample of 40 boys with high-functioning ASD (aged 9-17 years, mean age, 12.38±2.17; mean IQ, 105.60±16.06) and 42 typically developing (TD) boys (aged 9-17 years, mean age, 11.64±2.71; mean IQ, 111.29±13.45). Both groups received resting-state fMRI assessment after imaging data quality control for in-scanner head motion and spatial coverage. Seed-based approach was used to investigate iFC of the pRTPJ. TD and ASD boys demonstrated a resting-state pRTPJ iFC pattern comparable to the known spatial involvement of the default-mode network. Boys with ASD showed pRTPJ hyperconnectivity relative to TD boys in the right ventral occipito-temporal cortex. This atypically increased iFC in the ASD group was positively correlated with social deficits assessed by the Chinese version of the Autism Diagnostic Interview-Revised and the Social Responsive Scale.

      "abstract={The intraparietal sulcus (IPS), a region in the dorsal attention network (DAN), has been implicated in multi-sensory attention and working memory. Working memory and attention develop across childhood; changes in functional connectivity within the DAN may relate to this maturation. Previous findings regarding fronto-parietal intrinsic functional connectivity age-effects were mixed. Our study aimed to circumvent limitations of previous work using a large cross-sectional sample, 183 typically developing participants 6.5-20 years, from the Autism Brain Imaging Data Exchange, and seed regions along the anterior-to-posterior axis of the IPS. These seeds, IPS0-4, were entered into functional connectivity models. Group-level models investigated differential connectivity along the IPS and relationships with age. Anterior IPS3/4 exhibited greater connectivity with sensorimotor/pre-motor regions. Posterior IPS0/1 demonstrated greater connectivity with dorsal and ventral visual regions. Positive age-effects were found between IPS3-4 and visual regions. Negative age-effects were found between IPS and superior parietal and medial orbitofrontal cortices. Follow-up region of interest analyses were used to estimate age-effects for DAN and anticorrelated default mode network regions. Results suggest age-effects on IPS functional connectivity are relatively modest, and may differ pre- and across-adolescence. Studying typical age-related connectivity variability within this network may help to understand neurodevelopmental disorders marked by impaired attention. © 2015 The Authors.

      "abstract={One of the most consistent neuropsychological findings in autism spectrum disorders (ASD) is a reduced interest in and impaired processing of human faces. We conducted an activation likelihood estimation meta-analysis on 14 functional imaging studies on neural correlates of face processing enrolling a total of 164 ASD patients. Subsequently, normative whole-brain functional connectivity maps for the identified regions of significant convergence were computed for the task-independent (resting-state) and task-dependent (co-activations) state in healthy subjects. Quantitative functional decoding was performed by reference to the BrainMap database. Finally, we examined the overlap of the delineated network with the results of a previous meta-analysis on structural abnormalities in ASD as well as with brain regions involved in human action observation/imitation. We found a single cluster in the left fusiform gyrus showing significantly reduced activation during face processing in ASD across all studies. Both task-dependent and task-independent analyses indicated significant functional connectivity of this region with the temporo-occipital and lateral occipital cortex, the inferior frontal and parietal cortices, the thalamus and the amygdala. Quantitative reverse inference then indicated an association of these regions mainly with face processing, affective processing, and language-related tasks. Moreover, we found that the cortex in the region of right area V5 displaying structural changes in ASD patients showed consistent connectivity with the region showing aberrant responses in the context of face processing. Finally, this network was also implicated in the human action observation/imitation network. In summary, our findings thus suggest a functionally and structurally disturbed network of occipital regions related primarily to face (but potentially also language) processing, which interact with inferior frontal as well as limbic regions and may be the core of aberrant face processing and reduced interest in faces in ASD. © 2014, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.},\n",

      "abstract={Changes in UBE3A expression levels in neurons can cause neurogenetic disorders ranging from Angelman syndrome (AS) (decreased levels) to autism (increased levels). Here we investigated the effects on neuronal function of varying UBE3A levels using the Drosophila neuromuscular junction as a model for both of these neurogenetic disorders. Stimulations that evoked excitatory junction potentials (EJPs) at 1 Hz intermittently failed to evoke EJPs at 15 Hz in a significantly higher proportion of Dube3a over-expressors using the pan neuronal GAL4 driver C155-GAL4 (C155-GAL4>UAS-Dube3a) relative to controls (C155>+ alone). However, in the Dube3a over-expressing larval neurons with no failures, there was no difference in EJP amplitude at the beginning of the train, or the rate of decrease in EJP amplitude over the course of the train compared to controls. In the absence of tetrodotoxin (TTX), spontaneous EJPs were observed in significantly more C155-GAL4>UAS-Dube3a larva compared to controls. In the presence of TTX, spontaneous and evoked EJPs were completely blocked and mEJP amplitude and frequency did not differ among genotypes. These data suggest that over-expression of wild type Dube3a, but not a ubiquitination defective Dube3a-C/A protein, compromises the ability of motor neuron axons to support closely spaced trains of action potentials, while at the same time increasing excitability. EJPs evoked at 15 Hz in the absence of Dube3a (Dube3a15b homozygous mutant larvae) decayed more rapidly over the course of 30 stimulations compared to w1118 controls, and Dube3a15b larval muscles had significantly more negative resting membrane potentials (RMP). However, these results could not be recapitulated using RNAi knockdown of Dube3a in muscle or neurons alone, suggesting more global developmental defects contribute to this phenotype. These data suggest that reduced UBE3A expression levels may cause global changes that affect RMP and neurotransmitter release from motorneurons at the neuromuscular junction. Similar affects of under- and overexpression of UBE3A on membrane potential and synaptic transmission may underlie the synaptic plasticity defects observed in both AS and autism. © 2015.

      "abstract={Abstract Neuronal calcium sensor-1 (NCS-1) is the primordial member of a family of proteins responsible primarily for sensing changes in neuronal Ca2+ concentration. NCS-1 is a multispecific protein interacting with a number of binding partners in both calcium-dependent and independent manners, and acting in a variety of cellular processes in which it has been linked to a number of disorders such as schizophrenia and autism. Despite extensive studies on the Ca2+-activated state of NCS proteins, little is known about the conformational dynamics of the Mg2+-bound and apo states, both of which are populated, at least transiently, at resting Ca2+ conditions. Here, we used optical tweezers to study the folding behavior of individual NCS-1 molecules in the presence of Mg2+ and in the absence of divalent ions. Under tension, the Mg2+-bound state of NCS-1 unfolds and refolds in a three-state process by populating one intermediate state consisting of a folded C-domain and an unfolded N-domain. The interconversion at equilibrium between the different molecular states populated by NCS-1 was monitored in real time through constant-force measurements and the energy landscapes underlying the observed transitions were reconstructed through hidden Markov model analysis. Unlike what has been observed with the Ca2+-bound state, the presence of Mg2+ allows both the N- and C-domain to fold through all-or-none transitions with similar refolding rates. In the absence of divalent ions, NCS-1 unfolds and refolds reversibly in a two-state reaction involving only the C-domain, whereas the N-domain has no detectable transitions. Overall, the results allowed us to trace the progression of NCS-1 folding along its energy landscapes and provided a solid platform for understanding the conformational dynamics of similar EF-hand proteins. © 2015 Biophysical Society.},\n",

The ASD is defined as a neurodevelopmental disorder that disrupts normal patterns of connectivity between the brain regions. Therefore, the potential use of such abnormality for autism screening is investigated. The connectivity patterns are estimated from electroencephalogram (EEG) data collected from 8 brain regions under various mental states. The EEG data of 12 healthy controls and 6 autistic children (age matched in 7-10) were collected during eyes-open and eyes-close resting states as well as when subjects were exposed to affective faces (happy, sad and calm). Subsequently, the subjects were classified as autistic or healthy groups based on their brain connectivity patterns using pattern recognition techniques. Performance of the proposed system in each mental state is separately evaluated. The results present higher recognition rates using functional connectivity features when compared against other existing feature extraction methods. © 2015 Published by Elsevier B.V.},\n",

      "abstract={Resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rsfMRI) studies reveal a complex pattern of hyper- and hypo-connectivity in children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD). Whereas rsfMRI findings tend to implicate the default mode network and subcortical areas in ASD, task fMRI and behavioral experiments point to social dysfunction as a unifying impairment of the disorder. Here, we leverage a novel Bayesian framework for whole-brain functional connectomics that aggregates population differences in connectivity to localize a subset of foci that are most affected by ASD. Our approach is entirely data-driven and does not impose spatial constraints on the region foci or dictate the trajectory of altered functional pathways. We apply our method to data from the openly shared Autism Brain Imaging Data Exchange (ABIDE) and pinpoint two intrinsic functional networks that distinguish ASD patients from typically developing controls. One network involves foci in the right temporal pole, left posterior cingulate cortex, left supramarginal gyrus, and left middle temporal gyrus. Automated decoding of this network by the Neurosynth meta-analytic database suggests high-level concepts of \"language\" and \"comprehension\" as the likely functional correlates. The second network consists of the left banks of the superior temporal sulcus, right posterior superior temporal sulcus extending into temporo-parietal junction, and right middle temporal gyrus. Associated functionality of these regions includes \"social\" and \"person\". The abnormal pathways emanating from the above foci indicate that ASD patients simultaneously exhibit reduced long-range or inter-hemispheric connectivity and increased short-range or intra-hemispheric connectivity. Our findings reveal new insights into ASD and highlight possible neural mechanisms of the disorder. © 2015 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Inc.},\n",

We combined structural (CC area and DWI), functional (task-related fMRI activation and connectivity analyses) as well as behavioral (Poffenberger and Purdue tasks) measures to investigate IH integration in adult AS individuals of typical intelligence. Despite similar behavioral IH transfer time and performances in bimanual tasks, the CC sub-regions connecting frontal and parietal cortical areas were smaller in AS than in non-AS individuals, while those connecting visual regions were similar. The activation of visual areas was lower in AS than in non-AS individuals during the presentation of visual stimuli. Behavioral IH performances were related to the properties of CC subregions connecting motor areas in non-AS individuals, but to the properties of posterior CC regions in AS individuals. Furthermore, there was greater functional connectivity between visual areas in the AS than in the non-AS group. Levels of connectivity were also stronger in visual than in motor regions in the autistic subjects, while the opposite was true for the non-autistic group. Thus, visual IH transfer plays an important role in visuo-motor tasks in AS individuals. These findings extend the well established enhanced role of perception in autistic cognition to visuo-motor IH information transfer. © 2015 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Inc.},\n",

      "abstract={Autism spectrum disorders (ASD) are a group of neurodevelopmental conditions primarily characterized by abnormalities in social cognition. Abundant previous functional MRI studies have shown atypical activity in networks encompassing medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) and medial parietal regions corresponding to posterior cingulate cortex and precuneus (PCC/PCU). Conversely, studies assessing structural brain anomalies in ASD have been rather inconsistent. The current work evaluated whether structural changes in ASD can be reliability detected in a large multicenter dataset. Our comprehensive structural MRI framework encompassed cortical thickness mapping and structural covariance analysis based on three independent samples comprising individuals with ASD and controls (n=220), selected from the Autism Brain Imaging Data Exchange open-access database. Surface-based analysis revealed increased cortical thickness in ASD relative to controls in mPFC and lateral prefrontal cortex. Clusters encompassing mPFC were embedded in altered inter-regional covariance networks, showing decreased covariance in ASD relative to controls primarily to PCC/PCU and inferior parietal regions. Cortical thickness increases and covariance reductions in ASD were consistent, yet of variable effect size, across the different sites evaluated and measurable both in children and adults. Our multisite study shows regional and network-level structural alterations in mPFC in ASD that, possibly, relate to atypical socio-cognitive functions in this condition. © 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},\n",

      "abstract={Background: Previous autism research has hypothesized that abnormalities of functional connectivity in autism spectrum disorder (ASD) may vary with the spatial distance between two brain regions. Although several resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rsfMRI) studies have extensively examined long-range (or distant) connectivity in the adult ASD brain, short-range (or local) connectivity has been investigated in less depth. Furthermore, the possible relationship between functional connectivity and brain activity level during the resting state remains unclear. Methods: We acquired rsfMRI data from 50 adults with high-functioning ASD and 50 matched controls to examine the properties of spontaneous brain activity using measures of local and distant connectivity together with a measure of the amplitude of brain activity, known as fractional amplitude of low-frequency fluctuation (fALFF). The two connectivity measures were calculated using a common graph-theoretic framework. We also examined the spatial overlaps between these measures and possible relationships of these disrupted functional measures with autistic traits assessed by the Autism-Spectrum Quotient (AQ). Results: Compared to the controls, participants with ASD exhibited local over-connectivity in the right superior frontal gyrus and middle frontal gyrus, accompanied by local under-connectivity in the bilateral fusiform gyri (FG) and right middle temporal gyrus (MTG). On the other hand, we did not find any significant alterations in distant connectivity. Participants with ASD also exhibited reduced fALFF in the right middle occipital gyrus, lingual gyrus, and FG. Further conjunction and spatial overlap analyses confirmed that the spatial pattern of reduced fALFF substantially overlapped with that of local under-connectivity, demonstrating the co-occurrence of disrupted connectivity and spontaneous activity level in the right inferior occipital gyrus, posterior MTG (pMTG), and FG. Finally, within the ASD group, disrupted local connectivity in the right pMTG significantly correlated with the \"social interaction\" subscale score of the AQ. Conclusions: These findings revealed local functional disruptions in the occipital and temporal regions, especially the right FG and pMTG, in the form of co-occurrence of spontaneous brain activity level and local connectivity, which may underline social and communicative dysfunctions in adult ASD. © 2015 Itahashi et al.; licensee BioMed Central.},\n",

      "abstract={Neuroimaging techniques, such as fMRI, structural MRI, diffusion tensor imaging (DTI), and proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy (1H-MRS) have uncovered evidence for widespread functional and anatomical brain abnormalities in autism spectrum disorder (ASD) suggesting it to be a system-wide neural systems disorder. Nevertheless, most previous studies have focused on examining one index of neuropathology through a single neuroimaging modality, and seldom using multiple modalities to examine the same cohort of individuals. The current study aims to bring together multiple brain imaging modalities (structural MRI, DTI, and 1H-MRS) to investigate the neural architecture in the same set of individuals (19 high-functioning adults with ASD and 18 typically developing (TD) peers). Morphometry analysis revealed increased cortical thickness in ASD participants, relative to typical controls, across the left cingulate, left pars opercularis of the inferior frontal gyrus, left inferior temporal cortex, and right precuneus, and reduced cortical thickness in right cuneus and right precentral gyrus. ASD adults also had reduced fractional anisotropy (FA) and increased radial diffusivity (RD) for two clusters on the forceps minor of the corpus callosum, revealed by DTI analyses. 1H-MRS results showed a reduction in the N-acetylaspartate/Creatine ratio in dorsal anterior cingulate cortex (dACC) in ASD participants. A decision tree classification analysis across the three modalities resulted in classification accuracy of 91.9% with FA, RD, and cortical thickness as key predictors. Examining the same cohort of adults with ASD and their TD peers, this study found alterations in cortical thickness, white matter (WM) connectivity, and neurochemical concentration in ASD. These findings underscore the potential for multimodal imaging to better inform on the neural characteristics most relevant to the disorder. © 2015 Korean Biodiversity Information Facility (KBIF) in National Science Museum of Korea and Korea National Arboretum (KNA).},\n",

      "abstract={Background: Autism spectrum disorders (ASD) are a group of poorly understood behavioural disorders, which have increased in prevalence in the past two decades. Animal models offer the opportunity to understand the biological basis of these disorders. Studies comparing different mouse strains have identified the inbred BTBR T + tf/J (BTBR) strain as a mouse model of ASD based on its anti-social and repetitive behaviours. Adult BTBR mice have complete agenesis of the corpus callosum, reduced cortical thickness and changes in early neurogenesis. However, little is known about the development or ultimate organisation of cortical areas devoted to specific sensory and motor functions in these mice that may also contribute to their behavioural phenotype. Results: In this study, we performed diffusion tensor imaging and tractography, together with histological analyses to investigate the emergence of functional areas in the cerebral cortex and their connections in BTBR mice and age-matched C57Bl/6 control mice. We found evidence that neither the anterior commissure nor the hippocampal commissure compensate for the loss of callosal connections, indicating that no interhemispheric neocortical connectivity is present in BTBR mice. We also found that both the primary visual and somatosensory cortical areas are shifted medially in BTBR mice compared to controls and that cortical thickness is differentially altered in BTBR mice between cortical areas and throughout development. Conclusions: We demonstrate that interhemispheric connectivity and cortical area formation are altered in an age- and region-specific manner in BTBR mice, which may contribute to the behavioural deficits previously observed in this strain. Some of these developmental patterns of change are also present in human ASD patients, and elucidating the aetiology driving cortical changes in BTBR mice may therefore help to increase our understanding of this disorder. © Fenlon et al.},\n",

      "abstract={Background: Attention orienting is a cognitive process that facilitates the movement of attention focus from one location to another: this may be impaired in autism spectrum disorder (ASD). Dorsal and ventral attention networks (DAN and VAN) sub-serve the process of attention orienting. This study investigated the functional connectivity of attention orienting in these networks in ASD using the Posner Cueing Task. Method: Twenty-one adolescents with ASD and 21 age and IQ matched controls underwent functional magnetic resonance imaging. A psychophysical interaction (PPI) analysis was implemented to investigate task-dependent functional connectivity, measuring synchronicity of brain regions during the task. Regions of interest (ROI) were selected to explore functional connectivity in the DAN during cue-only conditions and in the VAN during invalid and valid trials. Results: Behaviourally, the ASD and control groups performed the task in a similar manner. Functional MRI results indicated that the ASD and control groups activated similar brain regions. During invalid trials (VAN), the ASD group showed significant positive functional connectivity to multiple brain regions, whilst the control group demonstrated negative connectivity. During valid trials (VAN), the two groups also showed contrasting patterns of connectivity. In the cue-only conditions (DAN), the ASD group showed weaker functional connectivity. Conclusion: The DAN analysis suggests that the ASD group has weaker coherence between brain areas involved in goal-driven, endogenous attention control. The strong positive functional connectivity exhibited by the ASD group in the VAN during the invalid trials suggests that individuals with ASD may generate compensatory mechanisms to achieve neurotypical behaviour.

      "abstract={Human empathic experience is a multifaceted psychological construct which arises from functional integration of multiple neural networks. Despite accumulating knowledge about the cortical circuitry of empathy, almost nothing is known about the connectivity that may be concerned in conveying empathy-related neural information. To bridge this gap in knowledge, we studied dispositional empathy in a large-sized cohort of 107 patients who had undergone surgery for a diffuse low-grade glioma. The self-report questionnaire used enabled us to obtain a global measure of subjective empathy but also, importantly, to assess the two main components of empathy (cognitive and emotional). Data were processed by combining voxelwise and tractwise lesion-symptom analyses. Several major findings emerged from our analyses. First of all, topological voxelwise analyses were inconclusive. Conversely, tractwise multiple regression analyses, including all major associative white matter pathways as potential predictors, yielded to significant models explaining substantial part of the behavioural variance. Among the main results, we found that disconnection of the left cingulum bundle was a strong predictor of a low cognitive empathy (p<0.0005 Bonferroni-corrected). Similarly, we found that disconnection of the right uncinate fasciculus and the right inferior fronto-occipital fasciculus predicted, respectively, a low (p<0.05 Bonferroni-corrected) and a high (p<0.05 Bonferroni-corrected) subjective empathy. Finally, although we failed to relate emotional empathy to disruption of a specific tract, correlation analyses indicated a positive association between this component of empathy and the volumes of residual lesion infiltration in the right hemisphere (p<0.01). Taken as a whole, these findings provide key fundamental insights into the anatomical connectivity of empathy. They may help to better understand the pathophysiology of empathy impairments in pathological conditions characterized by abnormalities of long-range anatomical connectivity, such as autism spectrum disorders, schizophrenia and fronto-temporal dementia. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.},\n",

      "abstract={Subjects with autism often show language difficulties, but it is unclear how they relate to neurophysiological anomalies of cortical speech processing. We used combined EEG and fMRI in 13 subjects with autism and 13 control participants and show that in autism, gamma and theta cortical activity do not engage synergistically in response to speech. Theta activity in left auditory cortex fails to track speech modulations, and to downregulate gamma oscillations in the group with autism. This deficit predicts the severity of both verbal impairment and autism symptoms in the affected sample. Finally, we found that oscillation-based connectivity between auditory and other language cortices is altered in autism. These results suggest that the verbal disorder in autism could be associated with an altered balance of slow and fast auditory oscillations, and that this anomaly could compromise the mapping between sensory input and higher-level cognitive representations. © 2015 Jochaut, Lehongre, Saitovitch, Devauchelle, Olasagasti, Chabane, Zilbovicius and Giraud.},\n",

      "abstract={Spontaneous imitation is assumed to underlie the acquisition of important skills by infants, including language and social interaction. In this study, functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) was used to examine the neural basis of 'spontaneously' driven imitation, which has not yet been fully investigated. Healthy participants were presented with movie clips of meaningless bimanual actions and instructed to observe and imitate them during an fMRI scan. The participants were subsequently shown the movie clips again and asked to evaluate the strength of their 'urge to imitate' (Urge) for each action. We searched for cortical areas where the degree of activation positively correlated with Urge scores; significant positive correlations were observed in the right supplementary motor area (SMA) and bilateral midcingulate cortex (MCC) under the imitation condition. These areas were not explained by explicit reasons for imitation or the kinematic characteristics of the actions. Previous studies performed in monkeys and humans have implicated the SMA and MCC/caudal cingulate zone in voluntary actions. This study also confirmed the functional connectivity between Urge and imitation performance using a psychophysiological interaction analysis. Thus, our findings reveal the critical neural components that underlie spontaneous imitation and provide possible reasons why infants imitate spontaneously. © The Author (2015).

      "abstract={Autism spectrum disorders (ASDs) comprise a heterogeneous set of neurodevelopmental disorders characterized by dramatic impairments of interpersonal behavior, communication, and empathy. Recent neuroimaging studies suggested that ASD are disorders characterized by widespread abnormalities involving distributed brain network, though clear evidence of differences in large-scale brain network interactions underlying the cognitive and behavioral symptoms of ASD are still lacking. Consistent findings of anterior insula cortex hypoactivation and dysconnectivity during tasks related to emotional and social processing indicates its dysfunctional role in ASD. In parallel, increasing evidence showed that successful control of anterior insula activity can be attained using real-time fMRI paradigms. More importantly, successful regulation of this region was associated with changes in behavior and brain connectivity in both healthy individuals and psychiatric patients. Building on these results we here propose and discuss the use of real-time fMRI neurofeedback in ASD aiming at improving emotional and social behavior. © 2015 Caria and de Falco.},\n",

      "abstract={Some studies highlight similarities between Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) and healthy aging. Indeed, the decline in older individuals’ ability to create a unified representation of the individual features of an event is thought to arise from a disruption of binding within the episodic buffer of working memory (WM) as the same way as observed in ASD. In both cases, this deficit may result from an abnormal engagement of a frontohippocampal network. The objective of the present study is to identify both cognitive processes and neural substrates associated with the deficit of binding in WM in healthy aging. We studied the capacity of binding and the cognitive processes that might subtend its decline in 72 healthy participants aged 18–84 years. We examined the behavioral data in relation to the changes in brain metabolism associated with the age-related decline in a subgroup of 34 healthy participants aged 20–77 years using the resting-state [18F] fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography (18F-FDG PET). Forward stepwise regression analyses showed that the age-related decline in binding was partially explained by a decline in inhibition and processing speed. PET correlation analyses indicated that metabolism of the frontal regions, anterior and middle cingulate cortices is implicated in this phenomenon. These data suggest that executive functions and processing speed may play a crucial role in the capacity to integrate unified representations in memory in aging. Possible implications are discussed in ASD. © 2015 Lecouvey, Quinette, Kalpouzos, Guillery-Girard, Bejanin, Gonneaud, Abbas, Viader, Eustache and Desgranges.},\n",

Since the visual processing has shown abnormalities in these disorders, we explored whether neuropathologic changes can be caused in the primary visual cortex in offsprings due to the maternal inflammation induced by a single lipopolysaccharide (LPS) injection in pregnant mouse dams. The morphology and electrophysiological properties of layer II pyramidal cells (L2PC) in the primary visual cortex were investigated with whole-cell patch-clamping recording and 3D neuron reconstruction techniques. Although the composition of two L2PC types was unchanged, a reorganization of the dendritic architecture was found in both L2PC_A and L2PC_B types, predominantly in the L2PC_A type, of the mice prenatally exposed to LPS. Moreover, prenatal LPS exposure differentially altered intrinsic electrophysiological properties of the two L2PC types. L2PC_A neurons showed reduced excitability as featured by a hyperpolarization of the resting membrane potential, whereas L2PC_B neurons showed enhanced excitability as featured by a decrease in cellular input resistance at resting membrane potential. These significant changes in neuronal morphological and electrophysiological properties might contribute to the dysfunctions of pyramidal neurons after maternal inflammation. © 2015 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.},\n",

      "abstract={Although the neurodevelopmental and genetic underpinnings of autism spectrum disorder (ASD) have been investigated, the etiology of the disorder has remained elusive, and clinical diagnosis continues to rely on symptom-based criteria. In this study, to classify both control subjects and a large sample of patients with ASD, we used resting state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI) and a neural network. Imaging data from 312 subjects with ASD and 328 subjects with typical development was downloaded from the multi-center research project. Only subjects under 20 years of age were included in this analysis. Correlation matrices computed from rs-fMRI time-series data were entered into a probabilistic neural network (PNN) for classification. The PNN classified the two groups with approximately 90% accuracy (sensitivity=92%, specificity=87%). The accuracy of classification did not differ among the institutes, or with respect to experimental and imaging conditions, sex, handedness, or intellectual level. Medication status and degree of head movement did not affect accuracy values. The present study indicates that an intrinsic connectivity matrix produced from rs-fMRI data could yield a possible biomarker of ASD.

Analyses carefully account for the effects of fcMRI motion artifact. Support vector machines (SVMs) classified 6 versus 12 month-old infants (128 datasets) above chance based on fcMRI data alone. Results demonstrate significant changes in measures of brain functional organization that coincide with a special period of dramatic change in infant motor, cognitive, and social development.

      "abstract={Functional connectivity analysis using resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI) has emerged as a powerful technique for investigating functional brain networks. The functional connectivity is often quantified by statistical metrics (e.g., Pearson correlation coefficient), which may be affected by many image acquisition and preprocessing steps such as the head motion correction and the global signal regression. The appropriate quantification of the connectivity metrics is essential for meaningful and reproducible scientific findings. We propose a novel empirical Bayes method to normalize the functional brain connectivity metrics on a posterior probability scale. Moreover, the normalization function maps the original connectivity metrics to values between zero and one, which is well-suited for the graph theory based network analysis and avoids the information loss due to the (negative value) hard thresholding step. We apply the normalization method to a simulation study and the simulation results show that our normalization method effectively improves the robustness and reliability of the quantification of brain functional connectivity and provides more powerful group difference (biomarkers) detection. We illustrate our method on an analysis of a rs-fMRI dataset from the Autism Brain Imaging Data Exchange (ABIDE) study. ï¿½ 2015 Chen, Kang and Wang.},\n",

Cellular, volumetric, and functional abnormalities of the cerebellum have been found in autism spectrum disorders (ASD), but no comprehensive investigation of cerebro-cerebellar connectivity in ASD is available. Methods We used resting-state functional connectivity magnetic resonance imaging in 56 children and adolescents (28 subjects with ASD, 28 typically developing subjects) 8-17 years old. Partial and total correlation analyses were performed for unilateral regions of interest (ROIs), distinguished in two broad domains as sensori-motor (premotor/primary motor, somatosensory, superior temporal, and occipital) and supramodal (prefrontal, posterior parietal, and inferior and middle temporal). Results There were three main findings: 1) Total correlation analyses showed predominant cerebro-cerebellar functional overconnectivity in the ASD group; 2) partial correlation analyses that emphasized domain specificity (sensori-motor vs. supramodal) indicated a pattern of robustly increased connectivity in the ASD group (compared with the typically developing group) for sensori-motor ROIs but predominantly reduced connectivity for supramodal ROIs; and 3) this atypical pattern of connectivity was supported by significantly increased noncanonical connections (between sensori-motor cerebral and supramodal cerebellar ROIs and vice versa) in the ASD group. Conclusions Our findings indicate that sensori-motor intrinsic functional connectivity is atypically increased in ASD, at the expense of connectivity supporting cerebellar participation in supramodal cognition. © 2015 Society of Biological Psychiatry.},\n",

We assessed the viability of resting-state functional MRI (rs-fMRI) connectivity measures as diagnostic biomarkers for ASD and investigated which connectivity features are predictive of a diagnosis. Methods Rs-fMRI scans from 59 high functioning males with ASD and 59 age- and IQ-matched typically developing (TD) males were used to build a series of machine learning classifiers. Classification features were obtained using 3 sets of brain regions. Another set of classifiers was built from participants' scores on behavioral metrics. An additional age and IQ-matched cohort of 178 individuals (89 ASD; 89 TD) from the Autism Brain Imaging Data Exchange (ABIDE) open-access dataset (http://fcon-1000.projects.nitrc.org/indi/abide/) were included for replication. Results High classification accuracy was achieved through several rs-fMRI methods (peak accuracy 76.67%). However, classification via behavioral measures consistently surpassed rs-fMRI classifiers (peak accuracy 95.19%). The class probability estimates, P(ASD|fMRI data), from brain-based classifiers significantly correlated with scores on a measure of social functioning, the Social Responsiveness Scale (SRS), as did the most informative features from 2 of the 3 sets of brain-based features. The most informative connections predominantly originated from regions strongly associated with social functioning. Conclusions While individuals can be classified as having ASD with statistically significant accuracy from their rs-fMRI scans alone, this method falls short of biomarker standards. Classification methods provided further evidence that ASD functional connectivity is characterized by dysfunction of large-scale functional networks, particularly those involved in social information processing.},\n",

To address these contradictory findings, we examined both inter-and intrahemispheric functional connectivity in several resting state data sets acquired from adults with high-functioning ASD and matched control participants. Our results reveal areas of both increased and decreased connectivity in multiple ASD groups as compared to control groups. We propose that this heterogeneity stems from a previously unrecognized ASD characteristic: idiosyncratic distortions of the functional connectivity pattern relative to the typical, canonical template. The magnitude of an individual's pattern distortion in homotopic interhemispheric connectivity correlated significantly with behavioral symptoms of ASD. We propose that individualized alterations in functional connectivity organization are a core characteristic of high-functioning ASD, and that this may account for previous discrepant findings. © 2015 Nature America, Inc.

      "abstract={Currently, the developmental trajectories of neural circuits implicated in autism spectrum disorders (ASD) are largely unknown. Here, we specifically focused on age-related changes in the functional circuitry of the posterior superior temporal sulcus (pSTS), a key hub underlying social-cognitive processes known to be impaired in ASD. Using a cross-sectional approach, we analysed resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data collected from children, adolescents and adults available through the autism brain imaging data exchange repository [n = 106 with ASD and n = 109 typical controls (TC), ages 7-30 years]. The observed age-related changes of pSTS intrinsic functional connectivity (iFC) suggest that no single developmental pattern characterizes ASD. Instead, pSTS circuitry displayed a complex developmental picture, with some functional circuits showing patterns consistent with atypical development in ASD relative to TC (pSTS-iFC with fusiform gyrus and angular gyrus) and others showing delayed maturation (pSTS-iFC with regions of the action perception network). Distinct developmental trajectories in different functional circuits in ASD likely reflect differential age-related changes in the socio-cognitive processes they underlie. Increasing insight on these mechanisms is a critical step in the development of age-specific interventions in ASD. © The Author (2015).},\n",

      "abstract={Background: Neuroimaging studies can shed light on the neurobiological underpinnings of autism spectrum disorders (ASD). Studies of the resting brain have shown both altered baseline metabolism from PET/SPECT and altered functional connectivity (FC) of intrinsic brain networks based on resting-state fMRI. To date, however, no study has investigated these two physiological parameters of resting brain function jointly, or explored the relationship between these measures and ASD symptom severity. Methods: Here, we used pseudo-continuous arterial spin labeling with 3D background-suppressed GRASE to assess resting cerebral blood flow (CBF) and FC in 17 youth with ASD and 22 matched typically developing (TD) children. Results: A pattern of altered resting perfusion was found in ASD versus TD children including frontotemporal hyperperfusion and hypoperfusion in the dorsal anterior cingulate cortex. We found increased local FC in the anterior module of the default mode network (DMN) accompanied by decreased CBF in the same area. In our cohort, both alterations were associated with greater social impairments as assessed with the Social Responsiveness Scale (SRS-total T scores). While FC was correlated with CBF in TD children, this association between FC and baseline perfusion was disrupted in children with ASD. Furthermore, there was reduced long-range FC between anterior and posterior modules of the DMN in children with ASD. Conclusion: Taken together, the findings of this study - the first to jointly assess resting CBF and FC in ASD - highlight new avenues for identifying novel imaging markers of ASD symptomatology. © 2015 Published by Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},\n",

      "abstract={Autism spectrum disorder is a prevalent neurodevelopmental disorder with no established pharmacological treatment for its core symptoms. Although previous literature has shown that single-dose administration of oxytocin temporally mitigates autistic social behaviours in experimental settings, it remains in dispute whether such potentially beneficial responses in laboratories can result in clinically positive effects in daily life situations, which are measurable only in long-term observations of individuals with the developmental disorder undergoing continual oxytocin administration. Here, to address this issue, we performed an exploratory, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover trial including 20 high-functional adult males with autism spectrum disorder. Data obtained from 18 participants who completed the trial showed that 6-week intranasal administration of oxytocin significantly reduced autism core symptoms specific to social reciprocity, which was clinically evaluated by Autism Diagnostic Observation Scale (P = 0.034, PFDR &lt; 0.05, Cohen's d = 0.78). Critically, the improvement of this clinical score was accompanied by oxytocin-induced enhancement of task-independent resting-state functional connectivity between anterior cingulate cortex and dorso-medial prefrontal cortex (rho = -0.60, P = 0.011), which was measured by functional magnetic resonance imaging. Moreover, using the same social-judgement task as used in our previous single-dose oxytocin trial, we confirmed that the current continual administration also significantly mitigated behavioural and neural responses during the task, both of which were originally impaired in autistic individuals (judgement tendency: P = 0.019, d = 0.62; eye-gaze effect: P = 0.03, d = 0.56; anterior cingulate activity: P = 0.00069, d = 0.97; dorso-medial prefrontal activity: P = 0.0014, d = 0.92; all, PFDR &lt; 0.05). Furthermore, despite its longer administration, these effect sizes of the 6-week intervention were not larger than those seen in our previous single-dose intervention. These findings not only provide the evidence for clinically beneficial effects of continual oxytocin administration on the core social symptoms of autism spectrum disorder with suggesting its underlying biological mechanisms, but also highlight the necessity to seek optimal regimens of continual oxytocin treatment in future studies. 10.1093/brain/awv249-video-abstract awv249-video-abstract © 2015 The Author (2015).

      "abstract={Whole-brain voxel-based unbiased resting state functional connectivity was analysed in 418 subjects with autism and 509 matched typically developing individuals. We identified a key system in the middle temporal gyrus/superior temporal sulcus region that has reduced cortical functional connectivity (and increased with the medial thalamus), which is implicated in face expression processing involved in social behaviour. This system has reduced functional connectivity with the ventromedial prefrontal cortex, which is implicated in emotion and social communication. The middle temporal gyrus system is also implicated in theory of mind processing. We also identified in autism a second key system in the precuneus/superior parietal lobule region with reduced functional connectivity, which is implicated in spatial functions including of oneself, and of the spatial environment. It is proposed that these two types of functionality, face expression-related, and of one's self and the environment, are important components of the computations involved in theory of mind, whether of oneself or of others, and that reduced connectivity within and between these regions may make a major contribution to the symptoms of autism. © 2015 The Author (2015).

      "abstract={Autism spectrum disorders (ASDs) are characterized by social impairments alongside cognitive and behavioral inflexibility. While social deficits in ASDs have extensively been characterized, the neurobiological basis of inflexibility and its relation to core clinical symptoms of the disorder are unknown. We acquired functional neuroimaging data from 2 cohorts, each consisting of 17 children with ASDs and 17 age-and IQ-matched typically developing (TD) children, during stimulus-evoked brain states involving performance of social attention and numerical problem solving tasks, as well as during intrinsic, resting brain states. Effective connectivity between key nodes of the salience network, default mode network, and central executive network was used to obtain indices of functional organization across evoked and intrinsic brain states. In both cohorts examined, a machine learning algorithm was able to discriminate intrinsic (resting) and evoked (task) functional brain network configurations more accurately in TD children than in children with ASD. Brain state discriminability was related to severity of restricted and repetitive behaviors, indicating that weak modulation of brain states may contribute to behavioral inflexibility in ASD. These findings provide novel evidence for a potential link between neurophysiological inflexibility and core symptoms of this complex neurodevelopmental disorder. © 2015 The Author.},\n",

      "abstract={Different test types lead to different intelligence estimates in autism, as illustrated by the fact that autistic individuals obtain higher scores on the Raven's Progressive Matrices (RSPM) test than they do on the Wechsler IQ, in contrast to relatively similar performance on both tests in non-autistic individuals. However, the cerebral processes underlying these differences are not well understood. This study investigated whether activity in the fluid \"reasoning\" network, which includes frontal, parietal, temporal and occipital regions, is differently modulated by task complexity in autistic and non-autistic individuals during the RSPM. In this purpose, we used fMRI to study autistic and non-autistic participants solving the 60 RSPM problems focussing on regions and networks involved in reasoning complexity. As complexity increased, activity in the left superior occipital gyrus and the left middle occipital gyrus increased for autistic participants, whereas non-autistic participants showed increased activity in the left middle frontal gyrus and bilateral precuneus. Using psychophysiological interaction analyses (PPI), we then verified in which regions did functional connectivity increase as a function of reasoning complexity. PPI analyses revealed greater connectivity in autistic, compared to non-autistic participants, between the left inferior occipital gyrus and areas in the left superior frontal gyrus, right superior parietal lobe, right middle occipital gyrus and right inferior temporal gyrus. We also observed generally less modulation of the reasoning network as complexity increased in autistic participants. These results suggest that autistic individuals, when confronted with increasing task complexity, rely mainly on visuospatial processes when solving more complex matrices. In addition to the now well-established enhanced activity observed in visual areas in a range of tasks, these results suggest that the enhanced reliance on visual perception has a central role in autistic cognition. © 2015 The Authors.

      "abstract={The cerebellum is one of the most consistent sites of abnormality in autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and cerebellar damage is associated with an increased risk of ASD symptoms, suggesting that cerebellar dysfunction may play a crucial role in the etiology of ASD. The cerebellum forms multiple closed-loop circuits with cerebral cortical regions that underpin movement, language, and social processing. Through these circuits, cerebellar dysfunction could impact the core ASD symptoms of social and communication deficits and repetitive and stereotyped behaviors. The emerging topography of sensorimotor, cognitive, and affective subregions in the cerebellum provides a new framework for interpreting the significance of regional cerebellar findings in ASD and their relationship to broader cerebro-cerebellar circuits. Further, recent research supports the idea that the integrity of cerebro-cerebellar loops might be important for early cortical development; disruptions in specific cerebro-cerebellar loops in ASD might impede the specialization of cortical regions involved in motor control, language, and social interaction, leading to impairments in these domains. Consistent with this concept, structural, and functional differences in sensorimotor regions of the cerebellum and sensorimotor cerebro-cerebellar circuits are associated with deficits in motor control and increased repetitive and stereotyped behaviors in ASD. Further, communication and social impairments are associated with atypical activation and structure in cerebro-cerebellar loops underpinning language and social cognition. Finally, there is converging evidence from structural, functional, and connectivity neuroimaging studies that cerebellar right Crus I/II abnormalities are related to more severe ASD impairments in all domains. We propose that cerebellar abnormalities may disrupt optimization of both structure and function in specific cerebro-cerebellar circuits in ASD. © 2015 D'Mello and Stoodley.},\n",

      "abstract={Objective Connectivity atypicalities in autism spectrum disorders (ASD) have been extensively proposed. The default mode network (DMN) is critical in this study, given the insight it provides for long-distance connectivity, and the importance of regions in this network for introspection and social emotion processing, areas affected in ASD. However, study of this network has largely been limited to adults; research earlier in development is lacking. The objective of this study was to examine DMN connectivity in children/adolescents with ASD. Methods A total of 115 children/adolescents, aged 6 to 17 years (71 males with ASD and 44 group age-matched TD males) were included in these analyses. We examined group differences in (1) functional connectivity between the posterior cingulate cortex and regions across the brain, (2) connectivity within the DMN as a function of age and intelligence quotient (IQ), and (3) the association between DMN connectivity and empathic accuracy. Results Individuals with ASD, relative to controls, showed either stronger or weaker connectivity between the posterior cingulate cortex (PCC) and DMN regions, depending on the region, but also showed stronger connectivity with non-DMN regions. A significant group-by-age interaction was observed in functional connectivity between the PCC and medial prefrontal cortex; connectivity increased with age in controls, but decreased in individuals with ASD. No effects of IQ were found. There was a significant group difference in the relation between DMN connectivity and empathic accuracy. Interpretation Differences in functional connectivity may suggest the presence of neural atypicalities that impact the development of typical connectivity in ASD. In addition to affecting DMN dynamics, these atypicalities may also impact social-cognitive abilities. Ann Neurol 2015;77:866-876 © 2015 American Neurological Association.},\n",

      "abstract={Hereditary and sporadic cerebellar ataxias represent a vast and still growing group of diseases whose diagnosis and differentiation cannot only rely on clinical evaluation. Brain imaging including magnetic resonance (MR) and nuclear medicine techniques allows for characterization of structural and functional abnormalities underlying symptomatic ataxias. These methods thus constitute a potential source of radiological biomarkers, which could be used to identify these diseases and differentiate subgroups of them, and to assess their severity and their evolution. Such biomarkers mainly comprise qualitative and quantitative data obtained from MR including proton spectroscopy, diffusion imaging, tractography, voxel-based morphometry, functional imaging during task execution or in a resting state, and from SPETC and PET with several radiotracers. In the current article, we aim to illustrate briefly some applications of these neuroimaging tools to evaluation of cerebellar disorders such as inherited cerebellar ataxia, fetal developmental malformations, and immune-mediated cerebellar diseases and of neurodegenerative or early-developing diseases, such as dementia and autism in which cerebellar involvement is an emerging feature. Although these radiological biomarkers appear promising and helpful to better understand ataxia-related anatomical and physiological impairments, to date, very few of them have turned out to be specific for a given ataxia with atrophy of the cerebellar system being the main and the most usual alteration being observed. Consequently, much remains to be done to establish sensitivity, specificity, and reproducibility of available MR and nuclear medicine features as diagnostic, progression and surrogate biomarkers in clinical routine. © 2014, Springer Science+Business Media New York.},\n",

We used the Autism Brain Imaging Data Exchange (ABIDE) sample to analyze locally focal (8 mm) functional connectivity of 223 autism patients and 285 normal controls from 15 international sites using a recently developed surface-based approach. We observed enhanced local connectivity in the middle frontal cortex, left precuneus, and right superior temporal sulcus, and reduced local connectivity in the right insular cortex. The local connectivity in the right middle frontal gyrus was positively correlated with the total score of the autism diagnostic observation schedule whereas the local connectivity within the right superior temporal sulcus was positively correlated with total subscores of both the communication and the stereotyped behaviors and restricted interests of the schedule. Finally, significant interactions between age and clinical diagnosis were detected in the left precuneus. These findings replicated previous observations that used a volume-based approach and suggested possible neuropathological impairments of local information processing in the frontal, temporal, parietal, and insular cortices. Novel site-variability analysis demonstrated high reproducibility of our findings across the 15 international sites.

      "abstract={Co-occurrence of preserved musical function with language and socio-communicative impairments is a common but understudied feature of Autism Spectrum Disorders (ASD). Given the significant overlap in neural organization of these processes, investigating brain mechanisms underlying speech and music may not only help dissociate the nature of these auditory processes in ASD but also provide a neurobiological basis for development of interventions. Using a passive-listening functional magnetic resonance imaging paradigm with spoken words, sung words and piano tones, we found that 22 children with ASD, with varying levels of functioning, activated bilateral temporal brain networks during sung-word perception, similarly to an age and gender-matched control group. In contrast, spoken-word perception was right-lateralized in ASD and elicited reduced inferior frontal gyrus (IFG) activity which varied as a function of language ability. Diffusion tensor imaging analysis reflected reduced integrity of the left hemisphere fronto-temporal tract in the ASD group and further showed that the hypoactivation in IFG was predicted by integrity of this tract. Subsequent psychophysiological interactions revealed that functional fronto-temporal connectivity, disrupted during spoken-word perception, was preserved during sung-word listening in ASD, suggesting alternate mechanisms of speech and music processing in ASD. Our results thus demonstrate the ability of song to overcome the structural deficit for speech across the autism spectrum and provide a mechanistic basis for efficacy of song-based interventions in ASD.

      "abstract={Objective: Early detection of autism is critical for effective intervention, but currently, no simple screening tests are available. Furthermore, little is known about the development of brain dynamics in young children. We examine the early neurophysiological manifestations of autism by retrospectively analyzing EEG. In particular, we focus on maturation of the posterior basic rhythm (PBR), which is one of the most characteristic features of the normal EEG, and comprises a discrete functional state. Methods: Subjects with a diagnosis of autism (n= 74), as well as normal (n= 134) and epileptic (n= 108) controls, were extracted retrospectively from our digital EEG database. Segments with clear PBR were extracted, and standard signal analysis methods were used to calculate peak PBR frequency, power, and coherence. Results: In our cohort, a subset of autistic children show accelerated development of the PBR, with early maturation especially in the 2- to 4-year old range. The overall coherence of PBR-specific activity is also lower in autistic children in our cohort. Conclusions: These findings provide evidence that autism is associated with accelerated development of the PBR. Significance: These findings generate a clinical hypothesis for future prospective studies on the efficacy of these simple measures as a diagnostic or screening tool. © 2014 International Federation of Clinical Neurophysiology.},\n",

      "abstract={Various lines of evidence accumulated over the past 30 years indicate that the cerebellum, long recognized as essential for motor control, also has considerable influence on perceptual processes. In this paper, we bring together experts from psychology and neuroscience, with the aim of providing a succinct but comprehensive overview of key findings related to the involvement of the cerebellum in sensory perception. The contributions cover such topics as anatomical and functional connectivity, evolutionary and comparative perspectives, visual and auditory processing, biological motion perception, nociception, self-motion, timing, predictive processing, and perceptual sequencing. While no single explanation has yet emerged concerning the role of the cerebellum in perceptual processes, this consensus paper summarizes the impressive empirical evidence on this problem and highlights diversities as well as commonalities between existing hypotheses. In addition to work with healthy individuals and patients with cerebellar disorders, it is also apparent that several neurological conditions in which perceptual disturbances occur, including autism and schizophrenia, are associated with cerebellar pathology. A better understanding of the involvement of the cerebellum in perceptual processes will thus likely be important for identifying and treating perceptual deficits that may at present go unnoticed and untreated. This paper provides a useful framework for further debate and empirical investigations into the influence of the cerebellum on sensory perception. © 2014, The Author(s).},\n",

      "abstract={Both schizophrenia (SCZ) and autism spectrum disorder (ASD) are characterized by mentalizing problems and associated neural dysfunction of the social brain. However, the deficits in mental state attribution are somehow opposed: Whereas patients with SCZ tend to over-attribute intentions to agents and physical events (\"hyper-intentionality\"), patients with autism treat people as devoid of intentions (\"hypo-intentionality\"). Here we aimed to investigate whether this hypo-hyper-intentionality hypothesis can be supported by neural evidence during a mentalizing task. Using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), we investigated the neural responses and functional connectivity during reading others intention. Scanning was performed in 23 individuals with ASD, 18 with paranoid SCZ and 23 gender and IQ matched control subjects. Both clinical groups showed reduced brain activation compared to controls for the contrast intentional vs physical information processing in left posterior superior temporal sulcus (pSTS) and ventral medial prefrontal cortex (vMPFC) for SCZ, and right pSTS in ASD. As predicted, these effects were caused in a group specific way: Relative increased activation for physical information processing in SCZ that was also correlated with positive PANNS score and relative decreased activation for intentional information processing in ASD. Additionally, we could demonstrate opposed connectivity patterns between the right pSTS and vMPFC in the clinical groups, ie, increased for SCZ, decreased for ASD. These findings represent opposed neural signatures in key regions of the social brain as predicted by the hyper-hypointentionality hypothesis. © The Author 2014.

      "abstract={High-functioning individuals with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) and age- and verbal IQ-matched controls (CTL) were fMRI scanned when playing \"stone paper scissors\". They believed they were playing against three different opponents: a Human, a Robot endowed with an artificial intelligence attempting to win the game, and a Computer running a random number generator. No differences between ASD and CTL reached significance in canonical mentalizing regions, in the medial prefrontal cortex and right temporoparietal junction. In contrast, activity in a cluster located in the left hypothalamus, attributed to the paraventricular hypothalamic nucleus (PHN), increased in the CTL, but not ASD, group when participants played against the human compared to the artificial agent. The left temporoparietal junction (lTPJ), that has been previously associated with anthropomorphization, influenced this PHN cluster activity differently between groups, with a significantly negative functional connectivity when CTL played against the robot and when ASD participants played against the human. Brain activity results are consistent with the hypothesis that hypothalamus-secreted neurohormones, including oxytocin, could support motivation for social interactions and be impaired in autism. Brain connectivity results suggest that cortical encoding of social context information, putatively related to anthropomorphism, has a reversed effect on hypothalamus activity in autism. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

      "abstract={IMPORTANCE More than half of youth with autism spectrum disorders (ASDs) have sensory overresponsivity (SOR), an extreme negative reaction to sensory stimuli. However, little is known about the neurobiological basis of SOR, and there are few effective treatments. Understanding whether SOR is due to an initial heightened sensory response or to deficits in regulating emotional reactions to stimuli has important implications for intervention. OBJECTIVE To determine differences in brain responses, habituation, and connectivity during exposure to mildly aversive sensory stimuli in youth with ASDs and SOR compared with youth with ASDs without SOR and compared with typically developing control subjects. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS Functional magnetic resonance imagingwas used to examine brain responses and habituation to mildly aversive auditory and tactile stimuli in 19 high-functioning youths with ASDs and 19 age- and IQ-matched, typically developing youths (age range, 9-17 years). Brain activity was related to parents' ratings of children's SOR symptoms. Functional connectivity between the amygdala and orbitofrontal cortex was compared between ASDs subgroups with and without SOR and typically developing controls without SOR. The study dates were March 2012 through February 2014. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Relative increases in blood oxygen level-dependent signal response across the whole brain and within the amygdala during exposure to sensory stimuli compared with fixation, as well as correlation between blood oxygen level-dependent signal change in the amygdala and orbitofrontal cortex. RESULTS The mean age in both groups was 14 years and the majority in both groups (16 of 19 each) were male. Compared with neurotypical control participants, participants with ASDs displayed stronger activation in primary sensory cortices and the amygdala (P < .05, corrected). This activity was positively correlated with SOR symptoms after controlling for anxiety. The ASDs with SOR subgroup had decreased neural habituation to stimuli in sensory cortices and the amygdala compared with groups without SOR. Youth with ASDs without SOR showed a pattern of amygdala downregulation, with negative connectivity between the amygdala and orbitofrontal cortex (thresholded at z > 1.70, P < .05). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Results demonstrate that youth with ASDs and SOR show sensorilimbic hyperresponsivity to mildly aversive tactile and auditory stimuli, particularly to multiple modalities presented simultaneously, and show that this hyperresponsivity is due to failure to habituate. In addition, findings suggest that a subset of youth with ASDs can regulate their responses through prefrontal downregulation of amygdala activity. Implications for intervention include minimizing exposure to multiple sensory modalities and building coping strategies for regulating emotional response to stimuli. © 2015 American Medical Association.

      "abstract={Numerous neuroimaging studies of autism spectrum disorders (ASD) have been conducted. Although many of the results of these studies do not overlap, some evidence has accumulated in support of the existence of some atypical brain morphology and function patterns. Indeed, studies have consistently reported structural abnormalities in the prefronto-striatal networks. Functional neuroimaging studies during social tasks have revealed altered patterns of activation in the fusiform gyrus and the superior temporal sulcus, two regions implicated in face recognition and social processing. Moreover, hypoactivation of the bilateral superior temporal gyri during language processing has also consistently been reported. Brain growth patterns are less clear. However, several studies have shown an atypical pattern, with overgrowth from birth to early infancy followed by a slower rate of growth compared to typically developing children and adults. Lastly, recent neuroimaging techniques such as diffusion tensor imaging and functional MRI connectivity measures have revealed long-range underconnectivity in ASD. Autism has thus been recently conceptualized as a brain connectivity disorder. This approach allows a better understanding of the failure of social and communication abilities in ASD. © 2015 S.

Method of study: To investigate the effect of MIA on the offspring, pregnant C57BL/6J mice were given an intraperitoneal injection of 50 μg/kg lipopolysaccharide (LPS) on gestational day 12.5. Results: Adult LPS-treated offspring were hyper-reactive to LPS, and enhanced tumor necrosis factor-α production was observed. CD4+ T cells from LPS offspring had an elevated percentage of interferon (IFN)-γ+ CD4+ T cells and interleukin (IL)-17A+ CD4+ T cells in the spleen, IL-17A+ CD4+ T cells in the liver, and CD4+ Foxp3+ T cells in the spleen. LPS offspring CD4+ T cells showed increased proliferation and an enhanced survival rate. DNA microarray analysis of resting LPS offspring CD4+ T cells identified eight up-regulated genes, most of which encoded transcription factors. Quantitative liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry identified 18 up-regulated proteins in resting LPS offspring CD4+ T cells and five up-regulated proteins in activated LPS offspring CD4+ T cells, most of which participated in the PANTHER Gene Ontology metabolic process. Conclusions: Our results showed that MIA to LPS up-regulated proteins involved in metabolic process in CD4+ T cells from LPS offspring that might contribute to the hyperactivated immune response of adult LPS offspring. © 2015 John Wiley & Sons A/S.

      "abstract={This review aims to relate the sensory processing problems in people with autism spectrum disorders (ASD), especially multisensory integration (MSI), to the role of the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) by exploring neuroanatomical findings; brain connectivity and Default Network (DN); global or locally directed attention; and temporal multisensory binding. The mPFC is part of the brain's DN, which is deactivated when attention is focused on a particular task and activated on rest when spontaneous cognition emerges. In those with ASD, it is hypoactive and the higher the social impairment the greater the atypical activity. With an immature DN, cross-modal integration is impaired, resulting in a collection of disconnected fragments instead of a coherent global perception. The deficit in MSI may lie in the temporal synchronization of neural networks. The time interval in which the stimulation of one sensory channel could influence another would be higher, preventing integration in the typical shorter time range. Thus, the underconnectivity between distant brain areas would be involved in top-down information processes (relying on global integration of data from different sources) and would enhance low level perception processes such as over focused attention to sensory details. © 2014 Martínez-Sanchis.},\n",

We recently found that topotecan reduces the expression of multiple long genes, including many neuronal genes linked to synapses and autism. However, whether topotecan alters synaptic protein levels and synapse function is currently unknown. Here we report that in primary cortical neurons, topotecan depleted synaptic proteins that are encoded by extremely long genes, including Neurexin-1, Neuroligin-1, Cntnap2, and GABAAβ3. Topotecan also suppressed spontaneous network activity without affecting resting membrane potential, action potential threshold, or neuron health. Topotecan strongly suppressed inhibitory neurotransmission via pre- and postsynaptic mechanisms and reduced excitatory neurotransmission. The effects on synaptic protein levels and inhibitory neurotransmission were fully reversible upon drug washout. Collectively, our findings suggest that TOP1 controls the levels of multiple synaptic proteins and is required for normal excitatory and inhibitory synaptic transmission.},\n",

      "abstract={Attention-deficit/hyperactive disorder (ADHD) and autism spectrum disorders (ASD) are two of the most common and vexing neurodevelopmental disorders among children. Although the two disorders share many behavioral and neuropsychological characteristics, most MRI studies examine only one of the disorders at a time. Using graph theory combined with structural and functional connectivity, we examined the large-scale network organization among three groups of children: a group with ADHD (8-12 years, n=20), a group with ASD (7-13 years, n=16), and typically developing controls (TD) (8-12 years, n=20). We apply the concept of the rich-club organization, whereby central, highly connected hub regions are also highly connected to themselves. We examine the brain into two different network domains: (1) inside a rich-club network phenomena and (2) outside a rich-club network phenomena. The ASD and ADHD groups had markedly different patterns of rich club and non rich-club connections in both functional and structural data. The ASD group exhibited higher connectivity in structural and functional networks but only inside the rich-club networks. These findings were replicated using the autism brain imaging data exchange dataset with ASD (n=85) and TD (n=101). The ADHD group exhibited a lower generalized fractional anisotropy and functional connectivity inside the rich-club networks, but a higher number of axonal fibers and correlation coefficient values outside the rich club. Despite some shared biological features and frequent comorbity, these data suggest ADHD and ASD exhibit distinct large-scale connectivity patterns in middle childhood. © 2014 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},\n",

We sought to explore neural mechanisms for cognitive reappraisal in children and adolescents with ASD using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). We studied 16 youth with ASD and 15 age- and IQ-matched typically developing (TD) comparison youth. Participants were instructed in the use of cognitive reappraisal strategies to increase and decrease their emotional responses to disgusting images. Participants in both groups displayed distinct patterns of brain activity for increasing versus decreasing their emotions. TD participants showed downregulation of bilateral insula and left amygdala on decrease trials, whereas ASD participants showed no modulation of insula and upregulation of left amygdala. Furthermore, TD youth exhibited increased functional connectivity between amygdala and ventrolateral prefrontal cortex compared to ASD participants when downregulating disgust, as well as decreased functional connectivity between amygdala and orbitofrontal cortex. These findings have important implications for our understanding of emotion dysregulation and its treatment in ASD.

      "abstract={Background: Visuospatial processing has been found to be mediated primarily by two cortical routes, one of which is unique to recognizing objects (occipital-temporal, ventral or \"what\" pathway) and the other to detecting the location of objects in space (parietal-occipital, dorsal or \"where\" pathway). Considering previous findings of relative advantage in people with autism in visuospatial processing, this functional MRI study examined the connectivity in the dorsal and ventral pathways in high-functioning children with autism. Methods: Seventeen high-functioning children and adolescents with autism spectrum disorders (ASD) and 19 age-and-IQ-matched typically developing (TD) participants took part in this study. A simple visual task involving object recognition and location detection was used. In the MRI scanner, participants were shown grey scale pictures of objects (e.g., toys, household items, etc.) and were asked to identify the objects presented or to specify the location of objects relative to a cross at the center of the screen. Results: Children with ASD, relative to TD children, displayed significantly greater activation in the left inferior parietal lobule (especially the angular gyrus) while detecting the location of objects. However, there were no group differences in brain activity during object recognition. There were also differences in functional connectivity, with the ASD participants showing decreased connectivity of the inferior temporal area with parietal and occipital areas during location detection. Conclusions: The results of this study underscore previous findings of an increased reliance on visuospatial processing (increased parietal activation) for information processing in ASD individuals. In addition, such processing may be more local, focal, and detailed in ASD as evidenced from the weaker functional connectivity. © 2014 DeRamus et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.},\n",

      "abstract={Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) based brain connectivity analysis maps the functional networks of the brain by estimating the degree of synchronous neuronal activity between brain regions. Recent studies have demonstrated that \"resting-state\" fMRI-based brain connectivity conclusions may be erroneous when motion artifacts have a differential effect on fMRI BOLD signals for between group comparisons. A potential explanation could be that in-scanner displacement, due to rotational components, is not spatially constant in the whole brain. However, this localized nature of motion artifacts is poorly understood and is rarely considered in brain connectivity studies. In this study, we initially demonstrate the local correspondence between head displacement and the changes in the resting-state fMRI BOLD signal. Than, we investigate how connectivity strength is affected by the population-level variation in the spatial pattern of regional displacement. We introduce Regional Displacement Interaction (RDI), a new covariate parameter set for second-level connectivity analysis and demonstrate its effectiveness in reducing motion related confounds in comparisons of groups with different voxel-vise displacement pattern and preprocessed using various nuisance regression methods. The effect of using RDI as second-level covariate is than demonstrated in autism-related group comparisons. The relationship between the proposed method and some of the prevailing subject-level nuisance regression techniques is evaluated. Our results show that, depending on experimental design, treating in-scanner head motion as a global confound may not be appropriate. The degree of displacement is highly variable among various brain regions, both within and between subjects. These regional differences bias correlation-based measures of brain connectivity. The inclusion of the proposed second-level covariate into the analysis successfully reduces artifactual motion-related group differences and preserves real neuronal differences, as demonstrated by the autism-related comparisons. © 2014 Spisak et al.},\n",

      "abstract={Background Autism spectrum disorders (ASDs) involve impairments in cognitive control. In typical development (TYP), neural systems underlying cognitive control undergo substantial maturation during adolescence. Development is delayed in adolescents with ASD. Little is known about the neural substrates of this delay. Methods We used event-related functional magnetic resonance imaging and a cognitive control task involving overcoming a prepotent response tendency to examine the development of cognitive control in young (ages 12-15; n = 13 with ASD and n = 13 with TYP) and older (ages 16-18; n = 14 with ASD and n = 14 with TYP) adolescents with whole-brain voxelwise univariate and task-related functional connectivity analyses. Results Older ASD and TYP showed reduced activation in sensory and premotor areas relative to younger ones. The older ASD group showed reduced left parietal activation relative to TYP. Functional connectivity analyses showed a significant age by group interaction with the older ASD group exhibiting increased functional connectivity strength between the ventrolateral prefrontal cortex and the anterior cingulate cortex, bilaterally. This functional connectivity strength was related to task performance in ASD, whereas that between dorsolateral prefrontal cortex and parietal cortex (Brodmann areas 9 and 40) was related to task performance in TYP. Conclusions Adolescents with ASD rely more on reactive cognitive control, involving last-minute conflict detection and control implementation by the anterior cingulate cortex and ventrolateral prefrontal cortex, versus proactive cognitive control requiring processing by dorsolateral prefrontal cortex and parietal cortex.

      "abstract={To investigate the synchronization of human bilateral cortical spontaneous activities in language areas and the relationship between the synchronization and language ability, optical brain imaging was used to measure resting state cortical activities in language areas of subjects with different language ability. The measured signals included temporal fluctuations of oxygenated- and deoxygenated-hemoglobin. Three groups of subjects participated in the experiment, including 25 children with autism, 11 normal children and 20 normal adults. Forty-four optical channels were used in the experiment to record the spontaneous fluctuations for 8 minutes from bilateral inferior and temporal cortices. After the recorded signals were filtered and processed to remove the global systemic interference, the temporal correlation coefficient was calculated for each channel pair located symmetrically on the left and the right hemisphere. This correlation coefficient reflects the synchronization of activities arising from cortical regions right beneath the channel pair. The average interhemispheric correlation coefficients for the symmetric regions of interest (e. g., inferior frontal cortex, temporal cortex) were also calculated and quantitatively compared between the three groups of subjects. Our data show the average inter-hemispheric correlations for temporal language cortices are different between subject groups; the correlation for children with autism (r = 0. 306 ± 0. 039) is significantly (P = 0. 048) lower than that for normal children (r =0. 472 ±0. 037), normal children is significantly (P =0. 00058) lower than normal adults (r = 0. 639 ± 0. 020), and adult males (r = 0. 604 ± 0. 035) is slightly lower than adult females (r = 0. 673 ± 0.017), but not significantly (P >0. 05). These results imply optical brain imaging may provide qualitative and quantitative evaluation on the functioning of human brain language network.},\n",

Resting state fMRI data were preprocessed firstly. Then the brain was parcellated into 108 ROIs with automated anatomical labeling atlas, and the time sequence signal was extracted. The functional connectivity strength was computed between each pair of ROIs for each subject. Finally, various graph metrics on the base of complex network theory were calculated. Results: Autism patients showed significantly altered topological properties of global brain network, such as decreased clustering coefficient and the shortest path, increased global efficiency, decreased local efficiency, modularity, and betweenness centrality. Conclusion: Compared with healthy normal subjects, the brain network integration increases and brain network segregation decreases in autism patients.

Data from 127 children with ASD (13.5±6.0 years) and 153 age- and gender-matched typically developing children (14.5±5.7 years) were selected from the multi-center Functional Connectome Project. Regional gray matter volume and cortical thickness increased, whereas white matter volume decreased in ASD compared to controls. Small-world network analysis of quantitative MRI data demonstrated decreased global efficiency based on gray matter cortical thickness but not with functional connectivity MRI (fcMRI) or volumetry. An integrative model of 22 quantitative imaging features was used for classification and prediction of phenotypic features that included the autism diagnostic observation schedule, the revised autism diagnostic interview, and intelligence quotient scores. Among the 22 imaging features, four (caudate volume, caudate-cortical functional connectivity and inferior frontal gyrus functional connectivity) were found to be highly informative, markedly improving classification and prediction accuracy when compared with the single imaging features. This approach could potentially serve as a biomarker in prognosis, diagnosis, and monitoring disease progression. © 2014 Zhou et al.},\n",

      "abstract={Background: Autism spectrum traits are postulated to lie on a continuum that extends between individuals with autism and individuals with typical development (TD). Social cognition properties that are deeply associated with autism spectrum traits have been linked to functional connectivity between regions within the brain's default mode network (DMN). Previous studies have shown that the resting-state functional connectivities (rs-FCs) of DMN are low and show negative correlation with the level of autism spectrum traits in individuals with autism spectrum disorder (ASD). However, it is unclear whether individual differences of autism spectrum traits are associated with the strength of rs-FCs of DMN in participants including the general population. Methods. Using the seed-based approach, we investigated the rs-FCs of DMN, particularly including the following two core regions of DMN: the anterior medial prefrontal cortex (aMPFC) and posterior cingulate cortex (PCC) in 19 young male adults with high-functioning ASD (mean age = 25.3 ± 6.9 years; autism-spectrum quotient (AQ) = 33.4 ± 4.2; full scale IQ (F-IQ) = 109.7 ± 12.4) compared with 21 age- and IQ-matched young male adults from the TD group (mean age = 24.8 ± 4.3 years; AQ = 18.6 ± 5.7; F-IQ = 109.5 ± 8.7). We also analyzed the correlation between the strength of rs-FCs and autism spectrum traits measured using AQ score. Results: The strengths of rs-FCs from core regions of DMN were significantly lower in ASD participants than TD participants. Under multiple regression analysis, the strengths of rs-FCs in brain areas from aMPFC seed showed negative correlation with AQ scores in ASD participants and TD participants. Conclusions: Our findings suggest that the strength of rs-FCs in DMN is associated with autism spectrum traits in the TD population as well as patients with ASD, supporting the continuum view. The rs-FCs of DMN may be useful biomarkers for the objective identification of autism spectrum traits, regardless of ASD diagnosis. © 2014 Jung et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.},\n",

      "abstract={Motor impairments are prevalent in children with autism spectrum disorders (ASD) and are perhaps the earliest symptoms to develop. In addition, motor skills relate to the communicative/social deficits at the core of ASD diagnosis, and these behavioral deficits may reflect abnormal connectivity within brain networks underlying motor control and learning. Despite the fact that motor abnormalities in ASD are well-characterized, there remains a fundamental disconnect between the complexity of the clinical presentation of ASD and the underlying neurobiological mechanisms. In this study, we examined connectivity within and between functional subregions of a key component of the motor control network, the precentral gyrus, using resting state functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging data collected from a large, heterogeneous sample of individuals with ASD as well as neurotypical controls. We found that the strength of connectivity within and between distinct functional subregions of the precentral gyrus was related to ASD diagnosis and to the severity of ASD traits. In particular, connectivity involving the dorsomedial (lower limb/trunk) subregion was abnormal in ASD individuals as predicted by models using a dichotomous variable coding for the presence of ASD, as well as models using symptom severity ratings. These findings provide further support for a link between motor and social/communicative abilities in ASD. © 2014 Nebel, Eloyan, Barber and Mostofsky.},\n",

      "abstract={Recent functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) studies on autism spectrum condition (ASC) have identified dysfunctions in specific brain networks involved in social and non-social cognition that persist into adulthood. Although increasing numbers of fMRI studies have revealed atypical functional connectivity in the adult ASC brain, such functional alterations at the network level have not yet been fully characterized within the recently developed graph-theoretical framework. Here, we applied a graph-theoretical analysis to resting-state fMRI data acquired from 46 adults with ASC and 46 age- and gender-matched controls, to investigate the topological properties and organization of autistic brain network. Analyses of global metrics revealed that, relative to the controls, participants with ASC exhibited significant decreases in clustering coefficient and characteristic path length, indicating a shift towards randomized organization. Furthermore, analyses of local metrics revealed a significantly altered organization of the hub nodes in ASC, as shown by analyses of hub disruption indices using multiple local metrics and by a loss of \"hubness\" in several nodes (e.g., the bilateral superior temporal sulcus, right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, and precuneus) that are critical for social and non-social cognitive functions. In particular, local metrics of the anterior cingulate cortex consistently showed significant negative correlations with the Autism-Spectrum Quotient score. Our results demonstrate altered patterns of global and local topological properties that may underlie impaired social and non-social cognition in ASC. © 2014 Itahashi et al.},\n",

In this study, functional near infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) was used to study the differences in functional connectivity in bilateral inferior frontal cortices (IFC) and bilateral temporal cortices (TC) between ASD and typically developing (TD) children between 8 and 11 years of age. As the first report of fNIRS study on the resting state functional connectivity (RSFC) in children with ASD, ten children with ASD and ten TD children were recruited in this study for 8 minute resting state measurement. Compared to TD children, children with ASD showed reduced interhemispheric connectivity in TC. Children with ASD also showed significantly lower local connectivity in bilateral temporal cortices. In contrast to TD children, children with ASD did not show typical patterns of symmetry in functional connectivity in temporal cortex.

In vertebrates early stages in the functional development of neurons and neuronal networks are difficult to study. Embryonic stem cell-derived neurons provide an easily accessible tool to investigate neuronal differentiation and early network formation. We used in vitro cultures of neurons derived from murine embryonic stem cells missing the methyl-CpG-binding protein 2 (MECP2) gene (MeCP2-/y) and from wild type cells of the corresponding background. Cultures were assessed using whole-cell patch-clamp electrophysiology and immunofluorescence. We studied the functional maturation of developing neurons and the activity of the synaptic connections they formed. Neurons exhibited minor differences in the developmental patterns for their intrinsic parameters, such as resting membrane potential and excitability; with the MeCP2-/y cells showing a slightly accelerated development, with shorter action potential half-widths at early stages. There was no difference in the early phase of synapse development, but as the cultures matured, significant deficits became apparent, particularly for inhibitory synaptic activity. MeCP2-/y embryonic stem cell-derived neuronal cultures show clear developmental deficits that match phenotypes observed in slice preparations and thus provide a compelling tool to further investigate the mechanisms behind RTT pathophysiology. © 2014 Barth, Sütterlin, Nenniger and Vogt.},\n",

Autism is characterized by a lack of left lateralization in structure and function of regions involved in language, such as Broca and Wernicke areas. Methods. Using functional connectivity magnetic resonance imaging from a large publicly available sample (n = 964), we tested whether abnormal functional lateralization in autism exists preferentially in language regions or in a more diffuse pattern across networks of lateralized brain regions. Results: The autism group exhibited significantly reduced left lateralization in a few connections involving language regions and regions from the default mode network, but results were not significant throughout left- and right-lateralized networks. There is a trend that suggests the lack of left lateralization in a connection involving Wernicke area and the posterior cingulate cortex associates with more severe autism. Conclusions: Abnormal language lateralization in autism may be due to abnormal language development rather than to a deficit in hemispheric specialization of the entire brain. © 2014 Nielsen et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.},\n",

      "abstract={Recent studies using Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) have proposed that the brain's white matter is organized as a rich club, whereby the most highly connected regions of the brain are also highly connected to each other. Here we use both functional and diffusion-weighted MRI in the human brain to investigate whether the rich club phenomena is present with functional connectivity, and how this organization relates to the structural phenomena. We also examine whether rich club regions serve to integrate information between distinct brain systems, and conclude with a brief investigation of the developmental trajectory of rich-club phenomena. In agreement with prior work, both adults and children showed robust structural rich club organization, comprising regions of the superior medial frontal/dACC, medial parietal/PCC, insula, and inferior temporal cortex. We also show that these regions were highly integrated across the brain's major networks. Functional brain networks were found to have rich club phenomena in a similar spatial layout, but a high level of segregation between systems. While no significant differences between adults and children were found structurally, adults showed significantly greater functional rich club organization. This difference appeared to be driven by a specific set of connections between superior parietal, insula, and supramarginal cortex. In sum, this work highlights the existence of both a structural and functional rich club in adult and child populations with some functional changes over development. It also offers a potential target in examining atypical network organization in common developmental brain disorders, such as ADHD and Autism. © 2014 Grayson et al.},\n",

      "abstract={Accumulating evidence suggests that motor impairments are prevalent in autism spectrum disorder (ASD), relate to the social and communicative deficits at the core of the diagnosis and may reflect abnormal connectivity within brain networks underlying motor control and learning. Parcellation of resting-state functional connectivity data using spectral clustering approaches has been shown to be an effective means of visualizing functional organization within the brain but has most commonly been applied to explorations of normal brain function. This article presents a parcellation of a key area of the motor network, the primary motor cortex (M1), a key area of the motor control network, in adults, typically developing (TD) children and children with ASD and introduces methods for selecting the number of parcels, matching parcels across groups and testing group differences. The parcellation is based solely on patterns of connectivity between individual M1 voxels and all voxels outside of M1, and within all groups, a gross dorsomedial to ventrolateral organization emerged within M1 which was left-right symmetric. Although this gross organizational scheme was present in both groups of children, statistically significant group differences in the size and segregation of M1 parcels within regions of the motor homunculus corresponding to the upper and lower limbs were observed. Qualitative comparison of the M1 parcellation for children with ASD with that of younger and older TD children suggests that these organizational differences, with a lack of differentiation between lower limb/trunk regions and upper limb/hand regions, may be due, at least in part, to a delay in functional specialization within the motor cortex.

      "abstract={The Abelson helper integration site 1 (AHI1) gene has a pivotal role in brain development. Studies by our group and others have demonstrated association of AHI1 with schizophrenia and autism. To elucidate the mechanism whereby alteration in AHI1 expression may be implicated in the pathogenesis of neuropsychiatric disorders, we studied Ahi1 heterozygous knockout (Ahi1 +/-) mice. Although their performance was not different from wild-type mice on tests that model classical schizophrenia-related endophenotypes, Ahi1 +/- mice displayed an anxiolytic-like phenotype across different converging modalities. Using behavioral paradigms that involve exposure to environmental and social stress, significantly decreased anxiety was evident in the open field, elevated plus maze and dark-light box, as well as during social interaction in pairs. Assessment of core temperature and corticosterone secretion revealed a significantly blunted response of the autonomic nervous system and the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis in Ahi1 +/- mice exposed to environmental and visceral stress. However, response to centrally acting anxiogenic compounds was intact. On resting-state functional MRI, connectivity of the amygdala with other brain regions involved in processing of anxiogenic stimuli and inhibitory avoidance learning, such as the lateral entorhinal cortex, ventral hippocampus and ventral tegmental area, was significantly reduced in the mutant mice. Taken together, our data link Ahi1 under-expression with a defect in the process of threat detection. Alternatively, the results could be interpreted as representing an anxiety-related endophenotype, possibly granting the Ahi1 +/- mouse relative resilience to various types of stress. The current knockout model highlights the contribution of translational approaches to understanding the genetic basis of emotional regulation and its associated neurocircuitry, with possible relevance to neuropsychiatric disorders. © 2014 Macmillan Publishers Limited All rights reserved.},\n",

While we are far from a complete understanding, these studies have yielded important insights into human brain development. There is an ever growing variety of methods for assessing connectivity, each with its own advantages. Here we review research on the development of structural and/or functional brain connectivity in both typically developing subjects and subjects with neurodevelopmental disorders. Space limitations preclude an exhaustive review of brain connectivity across all developmental disorders, so we review a representative selection of recent findings on brain connectivity in autism, Fragile X, 22q11.2 deletion syndrome, Williams syndrome, Turner syndrome, and ADHD. Major strides have been made in understanding the developmental trajectory of the human connectome, offering insight into characteristic features of brain development and biological processes involved in developmental brain disorders. We also discuss some common themes, including hemispheric specialization - or asymmetry - and sex differences. We conclude by discussing some promising future directions in connectomics, including the merger of imaging and genetics, and a deeper investigation of the relationships between structural and functional connectivity. © 2013 ISDN.},\n",

      "abstract={We sought to examine, via Phosphorus-31 magnetic resonance spectroscopy (31P-MRS) in a case-control design, whether bioenergetic deficits in autism spectrum disorders extend to the brain and muscle. Six cases with autism spectrum disorder with suspected mitochondrial dysfunction (age 6-18 years) and 6 age/sex-matched controls underwent 31P magnetic resonance spectroscopy. The outcomes of focus were muscle resting phosphocreatine and intracellular pH as well as postexercise phosphocreatine recovery time constant and frontal brain phosphocreatine. Intracellular muscle pH was lower in each autism spectrum disorder case than their matched control (6/6, P =.03; P =.0048, paired t test). Muscle phosphocreatine (5/6), brain phosphocreatine (3/4), and muscle phosphocreatine recovery time constant (3/3) trends were in the predicted direction (not all participants completed each). This study introduces 31P magnetic resonance spectroscopy as a noninvasive tool for assessment of mitochondrial function in autism spectrum disorder enabling bioenergetic assessment in brain and provides preliminary evidence suggesting that bioenergetic defects in cases with autism spectrum disorder are present in muscle and may extend to brain. © The Author(s) 2013.},\n",

      "abstract={Autism spectrum disorders (ASDs) represent a formidable challenge for psychiatry and neuroscience because of their high prevalence, lifelong nature, complexity and substantial heterogeneity. Facing these obstacles requires large-scale multidisciplinary efforts. Although the field of genetics has pioneered data sharing for these reasons, neuroimaging had not kept pace. In response, we introduce the Autism Brain Imaging Data Exchange (ABIDE) - a grassroots consortium aggregating and openly sharing 1112 existing resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (R-fMRI) data sets with corresponding structural MRI and phenotypic information from 539 individuals with ASDs and 573 age-matched typical controls (TCs; 7-64 years) (http://fcon-1000.projects. nitrc.org/indi/abide/). Here, we present this resource and demonstrate its suitability for advancing knowledge of ASD neurobiology based on analyses of 360 male subjects with ASDs and 403 male age-matched TCs. We focused on whole-brain intrinsic functional connectivity and also survey a range of voxel-wise measures of intrinsic functional brain architecture. Whole-brain analyses reconciled seemingly disparate themes of both hypo- and hyperconnectivity in the ASD literature; both were detected, although hypoconnectivity dominated, particularly for corticocortical and interhemispheric functional connectivity. Exploratory analyses using an array of regional metrics of intrinsic brain function converged on common loci of dysfunction in ASDs (mid- and posterior insula and posterior cingulate cortex), and highlighted less commonly explored regions such as the thalamus. The survey of the ABIDE R-fMRI data sets provides unprecedented demonstrations of both replication and novel discovery. By pooling multiple international data sets, ABIDE is expected to accelerate the pace of discovery setting the stage for the next generation of ASD studies. © 2014 Macmillan Publishers Limited.},\n",

      "abstract={Although the conception of autism as a disorder of abnormal resting-state physiology has a long history, the evidence remains mixed. Using state-of-the-art eye-tracking pupillometry, resting-state (tonic) pupil size was measured in children with and without autism. No group differences in tonic pupil size were found, and tonic pupil size was not related to age or cognitive ability in either group, and nor was it related to autistic symptoms. We suggest that previous findings of hyper-arousal in autism at baseline may be a product of different recording methods, in particular different movement-artifact removal techniques. These results question the notion that autism is associated with a fundamental dysregulation in resting-state physiology. Further research, employing such techniques is needed to confirm these findings. © 2014 Springer Science+Business Media.},\n",

      "abstract={Characterization of disease using stationary resting-state functional connectivity (FC) has provided important hallmarks of abnormal brain activation in many domains. Recent studies of resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), however, suggest there is a considerable amount of additional knowledge to be gained by investigating the variability in FC over the course of a scan. While a few studies have begun to explore the properties of dynamic FC for characterizing disease, the analysis of dynamic FC over multiple networks at multiple time scales has yet to be fully examined. In this study, we combine dynamic connectivity features in a multi-network, multi-scale approach to evaluate the method's potential in better classifying childhood autism. Specifically, from a set of group-level intrinsic connectivity networks (ICNs), we use sliding window correlations to compute intra-network connectivity on the subject level. We derive dynamic FC features for all ICNs over a large range of window sizes and then use a multiple kernel support vector machine (MK-SVM) model to combine a subset of these features for classification. We compare the performance our multi-network, dynamic approach to the best results obtained from single-network dynamic FC features and those obtained from both single- and multi-network static FC features. Our experiments show that integrating multiple networks on different dynamic scales has a clear superiority over these existing methods.},\n",

      "abstract={The development of language, social interaction, and communicative skills are remarkably different in the child with autism spectrum disorder (ASD). Atypical brain connectivity has frequently been reported in this patient population. However, the interplay between their brain connectivity and language performance remains largely understudied. Using diffusion tensor imaging tractography and resting-state fMRI, the authors explored the structural and functional connectivity of the language network and its relation to the language profile in a group of healthy control subjects (N = 25) and a group of children with ASD (N = 17). The authors hypothesized that in children with ASD, a neural connectivity deficit of the language network can be related to the observed abnormal language function. They found an absence of the right-hemispheric arcuate fascicle (AF) in 28% (7/25) of the healthy control children and in 59% (10/17) of the children with ASD. In contrast to healthy control children, the absence of the right-hemispheric AF in children with autism was related to a lower language performance as indicated by a lower verbal IQ, lower scores on the Peabody Picture Vocabulary Test, and lower language scores on the Dutch version of the Clinical Evaluation of Language Fundamentals (CELF-4NL). In addition, through iterative fMRI data analyses, the language impairment of children with ASD could be linked to a marked loss of intrahemispheric functional connectivity between inferior frontal and superior temporal regions, known as the cortical language network. Both structural and functional underconnectivity patterns coincide and are related to an abnormal language function in children with ASD. © 2013 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},\n",

      "abstract={Two hypotheses of autism spectrum disorder (ASD) propose that this condition is characterized by deficits in Theory of Mind and by hypoconnectivity between remote cortical regions with hyperconnectivity locally. The default mode network (DMN) is a set of remote, functionally connected cortical nodes less active during executive tasks than at rest and is implicated in Theory of Mind, episodic memory, and other self-reflective processes. We show that children with ASD have reduced connectivity between DMN nodes and increased local connectivity within DMN nodes and the visual and motor resting-state networks. We show that, like the trajectory of synaptogenesis, internodal DMN functional connectivity increased as a quadratic function of age in typically developing children, peaking between, 11 and 13 years. In children with ASD, these long-distance connections fail to develop during adolescence. These findings support the \"developmental disconnection model\" of ASD, provide a possible mechanistic explanation for the Theory-of-Mind hypothesis of ASD, and show that the window for effectively treating ASD could be wider than previously thought. © 2013 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},\n",

Although children learn causal attribution early in development, children with autism spectrum disorders (ASDs) are known to have impairments in the development of intentional causality. This functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) study investigated the neural correlates of physical and intentional causal attribution in people with ASDs. In the fMRI scanner, 15 adolescents and adults with ASDs and 15 age- and IQ-matched typically developing peers made causal judgments about comic strips presented randomly in an event-related design. All participants showed robust activation in bilateral posterior superior temporal sulcus at the temporo-parietal junction (TPJ) in response to intentional causality. Participants with ASDs showed lower activation in TPJ, right inferior frontal gyrus and left premotor cortex. Significantly weaker functional connectivity was also found in the ASD group between TPJ and motor areas during intentional causality. DTI data revealed significantly reduced fractional anisotropy in ASD participants in white matter underlying the temporal lobe. In addition to underscoring the role of TPJ in ToM, this study found an interaction between motor simulation and mentalizing systems in intentional causal attribution and its possible discord in autism. © The Author (2012).

      "abstract={IMPORTANCE Converging evidence indicates that brain abnormalities in autism spectrum disorder (ASD) involve atypical network connectivity, but it is unclear whether altered connectivity is especially prominent in brain networks that participate in social cognition. OBJECTIVE To investigate whether adolescents with ASD show altered functional connectivity in 2 brain networks putatively impaired in ASD and involved in social processing, theory of mind (ToM) and mirror neuron system (MNS). DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS Cross-sectional study using resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging involving 25 adolescents with ASD between the ages of 11 and 18 years and 25 typically developing adolescents matched for age, handedness, and nonverbal IQ. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Statistical parametric maps testing the degree of whole-brain functional connectivity and social functioning measures. RESULTS Relative to typically developing controls, participants with ASD showed a mixed pattern of both over- and underconnectivity in the ToMnetwork, which was associated with greater social impairment. Increased connectivity in the ASD group was detected primarily between the regions of the MNS and ToM, and was correlated with sociocommunicative measures, suggesting that excessive ToM-MNS cross talk might be associated with social impairment. In a secondary analysis comparing a subset of the 15 participants with ASD with the most severe symptomology and a tightly matched subset of 15 typically developing controls, participants with ASD showed exclusive overconnectivity effects in both ToMand MNS networks, which were also associated with greater social dysfunction. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Adolescents with ASD showed atypically increased functional connectivity involving the mentalizing and mirror neuron systems, largely reflecting greater cross talk between the 2. This finding is consistent with emerging evidence of reduced network segregation in ASD and challenges the prevailing theory of general long-distance underconnectivity in ASD. This excess ToM-MNS connectivitymay reflect immature or aberrant developmental processes in 2 brain networks involved in understanding of others, a domain of impairment in ASD. Further, robust links with sociocommunicative symptoms of ASD implicate atypically increased ToM-MNS connectivity in social deficits observed in ASD. © 2014 American Medical Association.

      "abstract={Autism Spectrum Disorder encompasses a range of neurodevelopmental disorders characterized by early deficits in social communication in addition to restricted and repetitive behaviors. Symptoms are increasingly understood to be associated with abnormalities in the coordination of neuronal assemblies responsible for processing information essential for early adaptive behaviors. Pharmacologic treatments carry evidence for clinically significant benefit of multiple impairing symptoms of ASD, yet these benefits are limited and range across a broad spectrum of medication classes, making it difficult to characterize associated neurochemical impairments. Increasing prevalence of both ASD and its pharmacologic management calls for greater understanding of the neurophysiologic basis of the disorder. This paper reviews underlying alterations in local brain regions and coordination of brain activation patterns during both resting state and taskrelated processes. We propose that new pharmacologic treatments may focus on realigning trajectories of network specialization across development by working in combination with behavioral treatments to enhance social and emotional learning by bolstering the impact of experience-induced plasticity on neuronal network connectivity. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2014.},\n",

      "abstract={The cingulum and fornix play an important role in memory, attention, spatial orientation and feeling functions. Both microstructure and length of these limbic tracts can be affected by mental disorders such as Alzheimer's disease, depression, autism, anxiety, and schizophrenia. To date, there has been little systematic characterization of their microstructure, length and functional connectivity in normally developing brains. In this study, diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) and resting state functional MRI (rs-fMRI) data from 65 normally developing right-handed subjects from birth to young adulthood was acquired. After cingulate gyrus part of the cingulum (cgc), hippocampal part of the cingulum (cgh) and fornix (fx) were traced with DTI tractography, absolute and normalized tract lengths and DTI-derived metrics including fractional anisotropy, mean, axial and radial diffusivity were measured for traced limbic tracts. Free water elimination (FWE) algorithm was adopted to improve accuracy of the measurements of DTI-derived metrics. The role of these limbic tracts in the functional network at birth and adulthood was explored. We found a logarithmic age-dependent trajectory for FWE-corrected DTI metric changes with fast increase of microstructural integrity from birth to 2-year-old followed by a slow increase to 25-year-old. Normalized tract length of cgc increases with age, while no significant relationship with age was found for normalized tract lengths of cgh and fx. Stronger microstructural integrity on the left side compared to that of right side was found. With integrated DTI and rs-fMRI, the key connectional role of cgc and cgh in the default mode network (DMN) was confirmed as early as birth. Systematic characterization of length and DTI metrics after FWE correction of limbic tracts offers insight into their morphological and microstructural developmental trajectories. These trajectories may serve as a normal reference for pediatric patients with mental disorders.© 2014 Yu, Peng, Mishra, Ouyang, Li, Zhang, Chen, Liu and Huang.},\n",

      "abstract={Autism spectrum conditions (ASC) are neurodevelopmental disorders characterized by abnormal social cognition. A core feature of ASC is disrupted Theory of Mind (ToM), our ability to take the mental perspective of others. ASC is also associated with alexithymia, a trait characterized by altered emotional interoception and empathy. Here, we applied structural MRI covariance analysis to assess whether ASC and alexithymia differentially affect structural brain networks associated with sociocognitive and socioaffective functions. Based on previous functional MRI findings, we expected disrupted ToM networks (centered on dorsomedial prefontal cortex [dmPFC], and temporo-parietal junction [TPJ]) in ASC, while alexithymia would affect networks centered on fronto-insular cortex (FI), regions associated with interoception of emotion and empathy. Relative to controls, ASC indeed showed reduced covariance in networks centered on dmPFC and TPJ, but not within FI networks. Irrespective of ASC, covariance was negatively modulated by alexithymia in networks extending from FI to posterior regions. Network findings were complemented by self-reports, indicating decreased perspective taking but normal empathic concern in ASC. Our results show divergent effects of ASC and alexithymia on inter-regional structural networks, suggesting that networks mediating socioaffective processes may be separable from networks mediating sociocognitive processing. © The Author 2013.

Despite the importance of direct gaze, previous functional magnetic resonance imaging in ASC has generally focused on paradigms using averted gaze. The current study sought to determine the neural processing of faces displaying direct and averted gaze in 18 males with ASC and 23 matched controls. Controls showed an increased response to direct gaze in brain areas implicated in theory-of-mind and gaze perception, including medial prefrontal cortex, temporoparietal junction, posterior superior temporal sulcus region, and amygdala. In contrast, the same regions showed an increased response to averted gaze in individuals with an ASC. This difference was confirmed by a significant gaze direction × group interaction. Relative to controls, participants with ASC also showed reduced functional connectivity between these regions. We suggest that, in the typical brain, perceiving another person gazing directly at you triggers spontaneous attributions of mental states (e.g. he is interested in me), and that such mental state attributions to direct gaze may be reduced or absent in the autistic brain. © 2013 The Author 2013.

      "abstract={Impairments in visual motion perception and use of visual motion information to guide behavior have been reported in autism, but the brain alterations underlying these abnormalities are not well characterized. We performed functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) studies to investigate neural correlates of impairments related to visual motion processing. Sixteen high-functioning individuals with autism and 14 age and IQ-matched typically developing individuals completed two fMRI tasks using passive viewing to examine bottom-up responses to visual motion and visual pursuit tracking to assess top-down modulation of visual motion processing during sensorimotor control. The autism group showed greater activation and faster hemodynamic decay in V5 during the passive viewing task and reduced frontal and V5 activation during visual pursuit. The observations of increased V5 activation and its faster decay during passive viewing suggest alterations in local V5 circuitries that may be associated with reduced GABAergic tone and inhibitory modulation. Reduced frontal and V5 activation during active pursuit suggest reduced top-down modulation of sensory processing. These results suggest that both local intrinsic abnormalities in V5 and more widely distributed network level abnormalities are associated with visual motion processing in autism.

      "abstract={Studies of autism spectrum disorders (ASDs) reveal dysfunction in the neural systems mediating object processing (particularly faces) and social cognition, but few investigations have systematically assessed the specificity of the dysfunction. We compared cortical responses in typically developing adolescents and those with ASD to stimuli from distinct conceptual domains known to elicit category-related activity in separate neural systems. In Experiment 1, subjects made category decisions to photographs, videos, and point-light displays of people and tools. In Experiment 2, subjects interpreted displays of simple, geometric shapes in motion depicting social or mechanical interactions. In both experiments, we found a selective deficit in the ASD subjects for dynamic social stimuli (videos and point-light displays of people, moving geometric shapes), but not static images, in the functionally localized lateral region of the right fusiform gyrus, including the fusiform face area. In contrast, no group differences were found in response to either static images or dynamic stimuli in other brain regions associated with face and social processing (e.g. posterior superior temporal sulcus, amygdala), suggesting disordered connectivity between these regions and the fusiform gyrus in ASD. This possibility was confirmed by functional connectivity analysis. © The Author 2012.},\n",

      "abstract={Autism spectrum disorders are associated with social and emotional deficits, the aetiology of which are not well understood. A growing consensus is that the autonomic nervous system serves a key role in emotional processes, by providing physiological signals essential to subjective states. We hypothesized that altered autonomic processing is related to the socio-emotional deficits in autism spectrum disorders. Here, we investigated the relationship between non-specific skin conductance response, an objective index of sympathetic neural activity, and brain fluctuations during rest in high-functioning adults with autism spectrum disorder relative to neurotypical controls. Compared with control participants, individuals with autism spectrum disorder showed less skin conductance responses overall. They also showed weaker correlations between skin conductance responses and frontal brain regions, including the anterior cingulate and anterior insular cortices. Additionally, skin conductance responses were found to have less contribution to default mode network connectivity in individuals with autism spectrum disorders relative to controls. These results suggest that autonomic processing is altered in autism spectrum disorders, which may be related to the abnormal socio-emotional behaviours that characterize this condition. © 2014 The Author (2014).},\n",

The present study investigated the neural mechanisms of inferring intentions from actions i individuals with ASD Methods: Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data were acquired from 21 high-functioning youn adults with ASD and 22 typically developing (TD) control participants, while making judgments about the mean (how an action is performed) and intention (why an action is performed) of a model's actions Results: Across both groups of participants, the middle and superior temporal cortex, extending to temporoparieta junction, and posterior cingulate cortex, responded significantly to inferring the intent of an action, while inferio parietal lobule and occipital cortices were active for judgments about the means of an action. Participants with AS had significantly reduced activation in calcarine sulcus and significantly increased activation in left inferior fronta gyrus, compared to TD peers, while attending to the intentions of actions. Also, ASD participants had weake functional connectivity between frontal and posterior temporal regions while processing intentions Conclusions: These results suggest that processing actions and intentions may not be mutually exclusive, wit reliance on mirroring and mentalizing mechanisms mediating action understanding. Overall, inferring informatio about others' actions involves activation of the mirror neuron system and theory-of-mind regions, and this activatio (and the synchrony between activated brain regions) appears altered in young adults with ASD. © 2014 Libero et al.},\n",

However, prior research relied on, designs that may place greater cognitive load on individuals with ASD. In order to address this issue, we adapted the fMRI task of Ochsner et al. (2004a) for children by, presenting fewer stimuli, with fewer valence levels, and longer stimuli duration. A localizer sample of, typically developing children (n = 26) was used to construct regions of interest involved in emotional, processing. Activations in these regions during self- and other-referential emotion processing was, compared in age, IQ, gender matched groups (n = 17 ASD, n = 16 TD). Matched samples replicate, condition contrasts of the localizer, but no group differences were found in behavior measures or, neural activation. An exploratory functional connectivity analysis in a subset of the matched groups, also did not detect striking differences between the groups. These findings suggest that disruptions in activation in emotion processing neural networks in ASD is partially a function of task related cognitive load. © 2013 The Authors.},\n",

      "abstract={NMDA-receptor (NMDAR) hypofunction is strongly implicated in the pathophysiology of schizophrenia. Several convergent lines of evidence suggest that net excitation propagated by impaired NMDAR signaling on GABAergic interneurons may be of particular interest in mediating several aspects of schizophrenia. However, it is unclear which behavioral domains are governed by a net increase of excitation and whether modulating downstream GABAergic signaling can reverse neural and thus behavioral deficits. The current study determines the selective contributions of NMDAR dysfunction on PV-containing interneurons to electrophysiological, cognitive, and negative-symptom-related behavioral phenotypes of schizophrenia using mice with a PVcre-NR1flox-driven ablation of NR1 on PV-containing interneurons. In addition, we assessed the efficacy of one agent that directly modulates GABAergic signaling (baclofen) and one agent that indirectly modifies NMDAR-mediated signaling through antagonism of mGluR5 receptors (2-methyl-6-(phenylethynyl) pyridine (MPEP)). The data indicate that loss of NMDAR function on PV interneurons impairs self-care and sociability while increasing N1 latency and baseline gamma power, and reducing induction and maintenance of long-term potentiation. Baclofen normalized baseline gamma power without corresponding effects on behavior. MPEP further increased N1 latency and reduced social behavior in PVcre/NR1+/+ mice. These two indices were negatively correlated before and following MPEP such that as N1 latency increases, sociability decreases. This finding suggests a predictive role for N1 latency with respect to social function. Although previous data suggest that MPEP may be beneficial for core features of autism spectrum disorders, current data suggest that such effects require intact function of NMDAR on PV interneurons. © 2014 American College of Neuropsychopharmacology.},\n",

Here we consider the role of Crus I of neocerebellum in supporting pSTS function. Research has associated Crus I activity with imitation and biological motion perception, and neocerebellum is theorized to coordinate activity among cerebral sites more generally. Moreover, cerebellar abnormalities have been associated with ASD. We hypothesized that disordered Crus I-pSTS interactions could predict social deficits in ASD. 15 high functioning adolescents with ASD and 15 same-age comparison youth participated in an fMRI imitation paradigm; ratings of mentalizing ability were collected via parent report. We predicted that stronger Crus I-pSTS interactions would be associated with better mentalizing ability. Consistent with these hypotheses, stronger psychophysiological interactions between Crus I and right pSTS were associated with greater mentalizing ability among adolescents with ASD. Whole-brain analyses also indicated that typically developing youth recruited right inferior frontal gyrus, left pSTS, medial occipital regions, and precuneus more strongly during imitation than did youth with ASD. Overall, these results indicate that variability in neocerebellar interactions with key cortical social brain sites may help explain individual differences in social perceptual outcomes in ASD. © 2014 The Authors.},\n",

      "abstract={Structural neuroimaging studies of autism spectrum disorder (ASD) have uncovered widespread neuroanatomical abnormalities, which may have a significant impact on brain function, connectivity, and on behavioral symptoms of autism. The findings of previous structural MRI studies have largely been distributed across several brain areas, with limited consistency. The current study examined neuroanatomical abnormalities by comparing surface-based measures of cortical morphology (CT: cortical thickness, CSA: cortical surface area, CV: cortical volume, and GI: gyrification index) in 55 high-functioning children and adults with ASD to 60 age-and-IQ-matched typically developing (TD) peers. A few brain areas, the fusiform gyrus (FG), middle temporal gyrus (MTG), and inferior frontal gyrus (IFG), emerged to be primarily different in their morphology between the two groups. Compared to TD participants, ASD participants had significantly smaller CV in left MTG, reduced CSA in bilateral MTG and FG, reduced GI in left supramarginal gyrus, and significantly increased CT in the pars opercularis of the IFG. As a function of age, ASD participants had significant reductions in: CT in the pars opercularis, CSA of the left rostral middle frontal gyrus, and GI for left supramarginal gyrus. Thus, alterations in cortical morphology in ASD were seen primarily in regions that are considered part of the social brain. Overall, these findings point to: neuroanatomical alterations in social brain areas, developmental differences in neuroanatomy, and the need to study neuroanatomy at multiple levels in order to better characterize the cortical architecture of ASD. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.},\n",

      "abstract={Secretory carrier membrane protein 5 (SCAMP5), a recently identified candidate gene for autism, is brain specific and highly abundant in synaptic vesicles (SVs), but its function is currently unknown. Here, we found that knockdown (KD) of endogenous SCAMP5 by SCAMP5-specific shRNAs in cultured rat hippocampal neurons resulted in a reduction in total vesicle pool size as well as in recycling pool size, but the recycling/resting pool ratio was significantly increased. SCAMP5 KD slowed endocytosis after stimulation, but impaired it severely during strong stimulation. We also found that KD dramatically lowered the threshold of activity at which SV endocytosis became unable to compensate for the ongoing exocytosis occurring during a stimulus. Reintroducing shRNA-resistant SCAMP5 reversed these endocytic defects. Therefore, our results suggest that SCAMP5 functions during high neuronal activity when a heavy load is imposed on endocytosis. Our data also raise the possibility that the reduction in expression of SCAMP5 in autistic patients may be related to the synaptic dysfunction observed in autism. © 2014 the authors.},\n",

      "abstract={In the field of cognitive neuroscience, it is increasingly accepted that mentalizing is subserved by a complex frontotemporoparietal cortical network. Some researchers consider that this network can be divided into two distinct but interacting subsystems (the mirror system and the mentalizing system per se), which respectively process low-level, perceptive-based aspects and high-level, inference-based aspects of this sociocognitive function. However, evidence for this type of functional dissociation in a given neuropsychological population is currently lacking and the structural connectivities of the two mentalizing subnetworks have not been established. Here, we studied mentalizing in a large sample of patients (n = 93; 46 females; age range: 18-65 years) who had been resected for diffuse low-grade glioma-a rare tumour that migrates preferentially along associative white matter pathways. This neurological disorder constitutes an ideal pathophysiological model in which to study the functional anatomy of associative pathways. We mapped the location of each patient's resection cavity and residual lesion infiltration onto the Montreal Neurological Institute template brain and then performed multilevel lesion analyses (including conventional voxel-based lesion-symptom mapping and subtraction lesion analyses). Importantly, we estimated each associative pathway's degree of disconnection (i.e. the degree of lesion infiltration) and built specific hypotheses concerning the connective anatomy of the mentalizing subnetworks. As expected, we found that impairments in mentalizing were mainly related to the disruption of right frontoparietal connectivity. More specifically, low-level and high-level mentalizing accuracy were correlated with the degree of disconnection in the arcuate fasciculus and the cingulum, respectively. To the best of our knowledge, our findings constitute the first experimental data on the structural connectivity of the mentalizing network and suggest the existence of a dual-stream hodological system. Our results may lead to a better understanding of disorders that affect social cognition, especially in neuropathological conditions characterized by atypical/aberrant structural connectivity, such as autism spectrum disorders. © 2014 The Author .},\n",

To investigate the usefulness of HRR in cardiorespiratory exercise testing in older adults with intellectual disabilities (ID), the aims of this study were (a) to assess HRR in older adults with ID after the 10-m incremental shuttle walking test (ISWT) and (b) its association with personal characteristics (gender, age, distance walked on the ISWT, level of ID, genetic syndrome causing ID, autism, behavioral problems, and peak heart rate (HRpeak)). HRR was assessed after the 10-m incremental shuttle walking test in 300 older adults (>50 years) with borderline to profound ID. HRR was defined as the change from HRpeak during the ISWT to heart rate measured after 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5. min of passive recovery. The largest decrease in heart rate was in the first minute of recovery leveling off toward the fifth minute of recovery. An abnormal HHR (≤12. bpm) was seen in 36.1% of the participants with Down syndrome (DS) and in 30.7% of the participants with ID by other causes. After the fifth minute the heart rates of 69.4% of the participants with DS and of 61.4% of the participants with ID by other causes returned to resting levels. HRpeak and distance walked on the ISWT were positively related to all HRR measures. More severe ID was negatively related and having DS positively related to HRR after 3-5. min of recovery. The other characteristics were not significantly associated to HRR. HRR is a potentially useful outcome measure in cardiorespiratory fitness testing of older adults with ID with a direct, objective, and non-invasive measurement. Further research is needed to identify the relation between HRR and adverse health outcomes in this population. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.},\n",

      "abstract={Multifaceted and idiosyncratic aberrancies in social cognition characterize autism spectrum disorders (ASDs). To advance understanding of underlying neural mechanisms, we measured brain hemodynamic activity with functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) in individuals with ASD and matched-pair neurotypical (NT) controls while they were viewing a feature film portraying social interactions. Pearson's correlation coefficient was used as a measure of voxelwise similarity of brain activity (InterSubject Correlations - ISCs). Individuals with ASD showed lower ISC than NT controls in brain regions implicated in processing social information including the insula, posterior and anterior cingulate cortex, caudate nucleus, precuneus, lateral occipital cortex, and supramarginal gyrus. Curiously, also within NT group, autism-quotient scores predicted ISC in overlapping areas, including, e.g., supramarginal gyrus and precuneus. In ASD participants, functional connectivity was decreased between the frontal pole and the superior frontal gyrus, angular gyrus, superior parietal lobule, precentral gyrus, precuneus, and anterior/posterior cingulate gyrus. Taken together these results suggest that ISC and functional connectivity measure distinct features of atypical brain function in high-functioning autistic individuals during free viewing of acted social interactions. Our ISC results suggest that the minds of ASD individuals do not 'tick together' with others while perceiving identical dynamic social interactions. © 2013 The Authors.},\n",

      "abstract={Autism spectrum disorder (ASD), a neurodevelopmental disorder affecting nearly 1 in 88 children, is thought to result from aberrant brain connectivity. Remarkably, there have been no systematic attempts to characterize whole-brain connectivity in children with ASD. Here, we use neuroimaging to show that there are more instances of greater functional connectivity in the brains of children with ASD in comparison to those of typically developing children. Hyperconnectivity in ASD was observed at the whole-brain and subsystems levels, across long- and short-range connections, and was associated with higher levels of fluctuations in regional brain signals. Brain hyperconnectivity predicted symptom severity in ASD, such that children with greater functional connectivity exhibited more severe social deficits. We replicated these findings in two additional independent cohorts, demonstrating again that at earlier ages, the brain of children with ASD is largely functionally hyperconnected in ways that contribute to social dysfunction. Our findings provide unique insights into brain mechanisms underlying childhood autism},\n",

      "abstract={The oxytocin receptor gene (OXTR) rs53576A has been associated with autism spectrum disorders (ASDs). A smaller hypothalamic volume has been reported in healthy male A-allele carriers than in male GG homozygotes and in patients with ASDs than in healthy controls. These findings prompt the hypothesis that male AA homozygotes may have weaker hypothalamic functional connectivity when compared to male G-allele carriers. We calculated local functional connectivity density (FCD) using a voxel-wise data-driven approach based on resting-state functional MRI data in 270 young healthy subjects. Both the main effect of genotype and the gender-by-genotype interaction were considered. Of the whole brain, only the local FCD of the hypothalamus exhibited the main effect of genotype. Post-hoc testing revealed significantly lower local FCD in male AA homozygotes compared to male G-allele carriers although there was only a trend of significance in the gender-by-genotype interaction. We further analyzed the resting-state functional connectivity (rsFC) of the hypothalamic region that demonstrating significant genotype differences in local FCD. We found a significant gender-by-genotype interaction in rsFC between the hypothalamic region and the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, but no significant main effect of genotype was found. Post-hoc testing revealed that this rsFC was significantly weaker in male AA homozygotes compared to male G-allele carriers. Our findings identify gender-dependent mechanisms of OXTR rs53576 gene variation impacting the functional connectivity of the hypothalamus in healthy individuals and suggest that these mechanisms are important for understanding ASDs. © 2013 Elsevier Inc.},\n",

We studied a human Kv10.2 channel mutation (R327H) recently identified in a child with epileptic encephalopathy and autistic features. Using multistate structural modeling, we demonstrate that the Arg327 residue in the S4 helix of voltage-sensing domain has strong ionic interactions with negatively charged residues within the S1-S3 helices in the resting (closed) and early-activation state but not in the late-activation and fully-activated (open) state. The R327H mutation weakens ionic interactions between residue 327 and these negatively charged residues, thus favoring channel opening. Voltage-clamp analysis showed a strong hyperpolarizing (~70 mV) shift of voltage dependence of activation and an acceleration of activation. Our results demonstrate the critical role of the Arg327 residue in stabilizing the channel closed state and explicate for the first time the structural and functional change of a Kv10.2 channel mutation associated with neurological disease. © 2013 the authors.},\n",

      "abstract={BTBR T+tf/J (BTBR) mice display prominent behavioural deficits analogous to the defining symptoms of autism, a feature that has prompted a widespread use of the model in preclinical autism research. Because neuro-behavioural traits are described with respect to reference populations, multiple investigators have examined and described the behaviour of BTBR mice against that exhibited by C57BL/6J (B6), a mouse line characterised by high sociability and low self-grooming. In an attempt to probe the translational relevance of this comparison for autism research, we used Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) to map in both strain multiple morpho-anatomical and functional neuroimaging readouts that have been extensively used in patient populations. Diffusion tensor tractography confirmed previous reports of callosal agenesis and lack of hippocampal commissure in BTBR mice, and revealed a concomitant rostro-caudal reorganisation of major cortical white matter bundles. Intact inter-hemispheric tracts were found in the anterior commissure, ventro-medial thalamus, and in a strain-specific white matter formation located above the third ventricle. BTBR also exhibited decreased fronto-cortical, occipital and thalamic gray matter volume and widespread reductions in cortical thickness with respect to control B6 mice. Foci of increased gray matter volume and thickness were observed in the medial prefrontal and insular cortex. Mapping of resting-state brain activity using cerebral blood volume weighted fMRI revealed reduced cortico-thalamic function together with foci of increased activity in the hypothalamus and dorsal hippocampus of BTBR mice. Collectively, our results show pronounced functional and structural abnormalities in the brain of BTBR mice with respect to control B6 mice. The large and widespread white and gray matter abnormalities observed do not appear to be representative of the neuroanatomical alterations typically observed in autistic patients. The presence of reduced fronto-cortical metabolism is of potential translational relevance, as this feature recapitulates previously-reported clinical observations. © 2013 Dodero et al.},\n",

      "abstract={Background: Individuals with autism spectrum disorders (ASD) often exhibit symptoms of attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). Across both disorders, observations of distributed functional abnormalities suggest aberrant large-scale brain network connectivity. Yet, common and distinct network correlates of ASD and ADHD remain unidentified. Here, we aimed to examine patterns of dysconnection in school-age children with ASD and ADHD and typically developing children who completed a resting state functional magnetic resonance imaging scan. Methods: We measured voxelwise network centrality, functional connectivity metrics indexing local (degree centrality [DC]) and global (eigenvector centrality) functional relationships across the entire brain connectome, in resting state functional magnetic resonance imaging data from 56 children with ASD, 45 children with ADHD, and 50 typically developing children. A one-way analysis of covariance, with group as fixed factor (whole-brain corrected), was followed by post hoc pairwise comparisons. Results: Cortical and subcortical areas exhibited centrality abnormalities, some common to both ADHD and ASD, such as in precuneus. Others were disorder-specific and included ADHD-related increases in DC in right striatum/pallidum, in contrast with ASD-related increases in bilateral temporolimbic areas. Secondary analyses differentiating children with ASD into those with or without ADHD-like comorbidity (ASD+ and ASD-, respectively) revealed that the ASD+ group shared ADHD-specific abnormalities in basal ganglia. By contrast, centrality increases in temporolimbic areas characterized children with ASD regardless of ADHD-like comorbidity. At the cluster level, eigenvector centrality group patterns were similar to DC. Conclusions: ADHD and ASD are neurodevelopmental disorders with distinct and overlapping clinical presentations.

We used regional homogeneity and local density approaches at different spatial scales to examine local connectivity in 29 children and adolescents with ASD and 29 matched typically developing participants, using resting state functional magnetic resonance imaging data. Across a total of 12 analysis pipelines, the gross pattern of between-group findings was overall stable, with local overconnectivity in the ASD group in occipital and posterior temporal regions and underconnectivity in middle/posterior cingulate, and medial prefrontal regions. This general pattern was confirmed in secondary analyses for low- motion subsamples (n = 20 per group), in which time series segments with >0.25 mm head motion were censored, as well as in an analysis including global signal regression. Local overconnectivity in visual regions appears consistent with preference for local over global visual processing previously reported in ASD, whereas cingulate and medial frontal underconnectivity may relate to aberrant function within the default mode network. © 2013 Maximo, Keown, Nair and Muller.},\n",

      "abstract={Cognition arises from the transient integration and segregation of activity across functionally distinct brain areas. Autism Spectrum Disorders (ASD), which encompass a wide range of developmental disabilities, have been presumed to be associated with a problem in cortical and sub-cortical dynamics of coordinated activity, often involving enhanced local but decreased long range coordination over areas of integration. In this paper we challenge this idea by presenting results from a relatively large population of ASD children and age-matched controls during a face-processing task. Over most of the explored domain, children with ASD exhibited enhanced synchronization, although finer detail reveals specific enhancement/reduction of synchrony depending on time, frequency and brain site. Our results are derived from the use of the imaginary part of coherency, a measure which is not susceptible to volume conduction artifacts and therefore presents a credible picture of coordinated brain activity. We also present evidence that this measure is a good candidate to provide features in building a classifier to be used as a potential biomarker for autism. © 2013 García Domínguez et al.},\n",

      "abstract={Background: Systematic differences in functional connectivity MRI metrics have been consistently observed in autism, with predominantly decreased cortico-cortical connectivity. Previous attempts at single subject classification in high-functioning autism using whole brain point-to-point functional connectivity have yielded about 80% accurate classification of autism vs. control subjects across a wide age range. We attempted to replicate the method and results using the Autism Brain Imaging Data Exchange (ABIDE) including resting state fMRI data obtained from 964 subjects and 16 separate international sites. Methods: For each of 964 subjects, we obtained pairwise functional connectivity measurements from a lattice of 7266 regions of interest covering the gray matter (26.4 million \"connections\") after preprocessing that included motion and slice timing correction, coregistration to an anatomic image, normalization to standard space, and voxelwise removal by regression of motion parameters, soft tissue, CSF, and white matter signals. Connections were grouped into multiple bins, and a leave-one-out classifier was evaluated on connections comprising each set of bins. Age, age-squared, gender, handedness, and site were included as covariates for the classifier. Results: Classification accuracy significantly outperformed chance but was much lower for multisite prediction than for previous single site results. As high as 60% accuracy was obtained for whole brain classification, with the best accuracy from connections involving regions of the default mode network, parahippocampaland fusiform gyri, insula, Wernicke Area, and intraparietal sulcus. The classifier score was related to symptom severity, social function, daily living skills, and verbal IQ. Classification accuracy was significantly higher for sites with longer BOLD imaging times. Conclusions: Multisite functional connectivity classification of autism outperformed chance using a simple leave-one-out classifier, but exhibited poorer accuracy than for single site results. Attempts to use multisite classifiers will likely require improved classification algorithms, longer BOLD imaging times, and standardized acquisition parameters for possible future clinical utility. © 2013 Nielsen, Zielinski, Fletcher, Alexander, Lange, Bigler, Lainhart and Anderson.},\n",

The network is lso active during directed tasks that require participantsto remember past events or imagine upcoming events. One hypothesis is that the network facilitates construction of mental models (simulations) that can be used adaptively in many contexts. Extensive research has considered whether disruption of the default network may contribute to disease. While an intriguing possibility, a specific challenge to this notion is the fact that it is difficult to ccurately measure the default network in patients where confounds of head motion and compliance are prominent. Nonetheless, some intriguing recent findings suggest that dysfunctional interactions between front-oparietal control systems and the default network contribute o psychosis. Psychosis may be a network disturbance that manifests as disordered thought, partly because it disrupts he fragile balance between the default network and competing brain systems. © 2013, AICH.},\n",

A variety of brain imaging methods can be used to probe how anatomy, connectivity, and function change in the developing brain. Here we review recent discoveries egarding these brain changes in both typically developing individuals and individuals with neurodevelopmental disorders. We begin with typical development, summarizing research on changes in regional brain volume and tissue ensity, cortical thickness, white matter integrity, and functional connectivity. Space limits preclude the coverage of all neurodevelopmental disorders; instead, we cover a representative selection of studies examining neural correlates of autism, attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder, Fragile X, 22q11.2 deletion syndrome, Williams syndrome, own syndrome, and Turner syndrome. Where possible, we focus on studies that identify an age by diagnosis interaction, suggesting an altered developmental trajectory. The studies we review generally cover the developmental period from infancy to early adulthood. Great progress has been made over the last 20 years in mapping how the brain matures with MR technology. With ever-improving technology, we expect this progress to accelerate, offering a deeper understanding of brain development, and more effective interventions for neurodevelopmental disorders. © 2013, AICH.},\n",

Two preliminary studies of children with ASDs suggest that there may be subgroups of ASDs depending on their resting arousal levels, and that these subgroups show different profiles of autonomic responsivity. The aim of the present study was to determine whether (i) adults with high-functioning ASDs may be separated into subgroups according to variation in resting arousal; and (ii) these ASD arousal subgroups differ in their behavioural profiles for basic emotion recognition, judgements of trustworthiness, and cognitive and affective empathy. Thirty high-functioning adults with ASDs and 34 non-clinical controls participated. Resting arousal was determined as the average skin conductance (SCL) across a 2. min resting period. There was a subgroup of ASD adults with significantly lower resting SCL. These individuals demonstrated poorer emotion recognition, tended to judge faces more negatively, and had atypical relationships between SCL and affective empathy. In contrast, low cognitive empathy was a feature of all ASD adults. These findings have important implications for clinical interventions and future studies investigating autonomic functioning in ASDs. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.},\n",

Children underwent functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) during two states, a resting state followed by a sustained attention task. A voxel-wise method was used to characterize functional connectivity at two levels, local (within a voxel's 14 mm neighborhood) and distant (outside of the voxel's 14 mm neighborhood to the rest of the brain) and regions exhibiting Group × State interaction were identified for both types of connectivity maps. Distant functional connectivity of regions in the left frontal lobe (dorsolateral [BA 11, 10]; supplementary motor area extending into dorsal anterior cingulate [BA 32/8]; and premotor [BA 6, 8, 9]), right parietal lobe (paracentral lobule [BA 6]; angular gyrus [BA 39/40]), and left posterior middle temporal cortex (BA 19/39) showed a Group × State interaction such that relative to the resting state, connectivity reduced (i.e., became focal) in control children but increased (i.e., became diffuse) in ASD children during the task state. Higher state-related increase in distant connectivity of left frontal and right angular gyrus predicted worse inattention in ASD children. Two graph theory measures (global efficiency and modularity) were also sensitive to Group × State differences, with the magnitude of state-related change predicting inattention in the ASD children. Our results indicate that as ASD children transition from an unconstrained to a sustained attentional state, functional connectivity of frontal and parietal regions with the rest of the brain becomes more widespread in a manner that may be maladaptive as it was associated with attention problems in everyday life. © 2013 You, Norr, Murphy, Kuschner, Bal, Gaillard, Kenworthy and Vaidya.},\n",

      "abstract={Individuals with Autism Spectrum Conditions (ASC) have difficulties in social interaction and communication, which is reflected in hypoactivation of brain regions engaged in social processing, such as medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC), amygdala and insula. Resting state studies in ASC have identified reduced connectivity of the default mode network (DMN), which includes mPFC, suggesting that other resting state networks incorporating 'social' brain regions may also be abnormal. Using Seed-based Connectivity and Group Independent Component Analysis (ICA) approaches, we looked at resting functional connectivity in ASC between specific 'social' brain regions, as well as within and between whole networks incorporating these regions. We found reduced functional connectivity within the DMN in individuals with ASC, using both ICA and seed-based approaches. Two further networks identified by ICA, the salience network, incorporating the insula and a medial temporal lobe network, incorporating the amygdala, showed reduced inter-network connectivity. This was underlined by reduced seed-based connectivity between the insula and amygdala. The results demonstrate significantly reduced functional connectivity within and between resting state networks incorporating 'social' brain regions. This reduced connectivity may result in difficulties in communication and integration of information across these networks, which could contribute to the impaired processing of social signals in ASC. © The Author(s) 2012.

      "abstract={Background: The default mode network (DMN), a brain system anchored in the posteromedial cortex, has been identified as underconnected in adults with autism spectrum disorder (ASD). However, to date there have been no attempts to characterize this network and its involvement in mediating social deficits in children with ASD. Furthermore, the functionally heterogeneous profile of the posteromedial cortex raises questions regarding how altered connectivity manifests in specific functional modules within this brain region in children with ASD. Methods: Resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging and an anatomically informed approach were used to investigate the functional connectivity of the DMN in 20 children with ASD and 19 age-, gender-, and IQ-matched typically developing (TD) children. Multivariate regression analyses were used to test whether altered patterns of connectivity are predictive of social impairment severity. Results: Compared with TD children, children with ASD demonstrated hyperconnectivity of the posterior cingulate and retrosplenial cortices with predominately medial and anterolateral temporal cortex. In contrast, the precuneus in ASD children demonstrated hypoconnectivity with visual cortex, basal ganglia, and locally within the posteromedial cortex. Aberrant posterior cingulate cortex hyperconnectivity was linked with severity of social impairments in ASD, whereas precuneus hypoconnectivity was unrelated to social deficits. Consistent with previous work in healthy adults, a functionally heterogeneous profile of connectivity within the posteromedial cortex in both TD and ASD children was observed. Conclusions: This work links hyperconnectivity of DMN-related circuits to the core social deficits in young children with ASD and highlights fundamental aspects of posteromedial cortex heterogeneity. © 2013 Society of Biological Psychiatry.},\n",

      "abstract={Comparison of brain function between children and adults with autism provides an understanding of the effects of the disorder and associated maturational differences on language processing. Functional imaging (functional magnetic resonance imaging) was used to examine brain activation and cortical synchronization during the processing of literal and ironic texts in 15 children with autism, 14 children with typical development, 13 adults with autism, and 12 adult controls. Both the children and adults with autism had lower functional connectivity (synchronization of brain activity among activated areas) than their age and ability comparison group in the left hemisphere language network during irony processing, and neither autism group had an increase in functional connectivity in response to increased task demands. Activation differences for the literal and irony conditions occurred in key language-processing regions (left middle temporal, left pars triangularis, left pars opercularis, left medial frontal, and right middle temporal). The children and adults with autism differed from each other in the use of some brain regions during the irony task, with the adults with autism having activation levels similar to those of the control groups. Overall, the children and adults with autism differed from the adult and child controls in (a) the degree of network coordination, (b) the distribution of the workload among member nodes, and (3) the dynamic recruitment of regions in response to text content. Moreover, the differences between the two autism age groups may be indicative of positive changes in the neural function related to language processing associated with maturation and/or educational experience.

      "abstract={Individuals with autism spectrum disorders (ASDs) often show insensitivity to the human voice, a deficit that is thought to play a key role in communication deficits in this population. The social motivation theory of ASD predicts that impaired function of reward and emotional systems impedes children with ASD from actively engaging with speech. Here we explore this theory by investigating distributed brain systems underlying human voice perception in children with ASD. Using resting-state functional MRI data acquired from 20 children with ASD and 19 age- and intelligence quotientmatched typically developing children, we examined intrinsic functional connectivity of voice-selective bilateral posterior superior temporal sulcus (pSTS). Children with ASD showed a striking pattern of underconnectivity between left-hemisphere pSTS and distributed nodes of the dopaminergic reward pathway, including bilateral ventral tegmental areas and nucleus accumbens, left-hemisphere insula, orbitofrontal cortex, and ventromedial prefrontal cortex. Children with ASD also showed underconnectivity between righthemisphere pSTS, a region known for processing speech prosody, and the orbitofrontal cortex and amygdala, brain regions critical for emotion-related associative learning. The degree of underconnectivity between voice-selective cortex and reward pathways predicted symptom severity for communication deficits in children with ASD. Our results suggest that weak connectivity of voiceselective cortex and brain structures involved in reward and emotion may impair the ability of children with ASD to experience speech as a pleasurable stimulus, thereby impacting language and social skill development in this population. Our study provides support for the social motivation theory of ASD.},\n",

      "abstract={Disruption of structural and functional neural connectivity has been widely reported in Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) but there is a striking lack of research attempting to integrate analysis of functional and structural connectivity in the same study population, an approach that may provide key insights into the specific neurobiological underpinnings of altered functional connectivity in autism. The aims of this study were 1. to determine whether functional connectivity abnormalities were associated with structural abnormalities of white matter (WM) in ASD and 2. to examine the relationships between aberrant neural connectivity and behaviour in ASD. 22 individuals with ASD and 22 age, IQ-matched controls completed a high-angular-resolution diffusion MRI scan. Structural connectivity was analysed using constrained spherical deconvolution based tractography. Regions for tractography were generated from the results of a previous study, in which 10 pairs of brain regions showed abnormal functional connectivity during visuospatial processing in ASD. WM tracts directly connected 5 of the 10 region pairs that showed abnormal functional connectivity; linking a region in the left occipital lobe (left BA19) and five paired regions: left caudate head, left caudate body, left uncus, left thalamus and left cuneus. Measures of WM microstructural organisation were extracted from these tracts. Fractional anisotropy reductions in the ASD group relative to controls were significant for WM connecting left BA19 to left caudate head and left BA19 to left thalamus. Using a multimodal imaging approach, this study has revealed aberrant white matter microstructure in tracts that directly connect brain regions that are abnormally functionally connected in ASD. These results provide novel evidence to suggest that structural brain pathology may contribute 1. to abnormal functional connectivity and 2. to atypical visuospatial processing in ASD. © 2013 McGrath, Johnson, O'Hanlon, Garavan, Leemans and Gallagher.},\n",

      "abstract={Abnormalities in frontostriatal circuitry potentially underlie the two core deficits in Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD); social interaction and communication difficulties and restricted interests and repetitive behaviours. Whilst a few studies have examined connectivity within this circuitry in ASD, no previous study has examined both functional and structural connectivity within the same population. The present study provides the first exploration of both functional and structural frontostriatal connectivity in ASD. Twenty-eight right-handed Caucasian male ASD (17.28±3.57yrs) and 27 right- handed male, age and IQ matched controls (17.15±3.64yrs) took part in the study. Resting state functional connectivity was carried out on 21 ASD and control participants, and tractography was carried out on 22 ASD and 24 control participants, after excluding subjects for excessive motion and poor data quality. Functional connectivity analysis was carried out between the frontal cortex and striatum after which tractography was performed between regions that showed significant group differences in functional connectivity. The ASD group showed increased functional connectivity between regions in the frontal cortex (anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), middle frontal gyrus (MFG), paracingulate gyrus (Pcg) and orbitofrontal cortex (OFC)), and striatum (nucleus accumbens (NAcc) and caudate). Increased functional connectivity between ACC and caudate was associated with deactivation to social rewards in the caudate, as previously reported in the same participants. Greater connectivity between the right MFG and caudate was associated with higher restricted interests and repetitive behaviours and connectivity between the bilateral Pcg and NAcc, and the right OFC and NAcc, was negatively associated with social and communicative deficits. Although tracts were reliably constructed for each subject, there were no group differences in structural connectivity. Results are in keeping with previously reported increased corticostriatal functional connectivity in ASD. © 2013 Delmonte, Gallagher, O'hanlon, Mcgrath and Balsters.},\n",

      "abstract={We have previously argued from a theoretical basis that the standard practice of regression of the Global Signal from the fMRI time series in functional connectivity studies is ill advised, particularly when comparing groups of participants. Here, we demonstrate in resting-state data from participants with an Autism Spectrum Disorder and matched controls that these concerns are also well founded in real data. Using the prior theoretical work to formulate predictions, we show: (1) rather than simply altering the mean or range of correlation values amongst pairs of brain regions, Global Signal Regression systematically alters the rank ordering of values in addition to introducing negative values, (2) it leads to a reversal in the direction of group correlation differences relative to other preprocessing approaches, with a higher incidence of both long-range and local correlation differences that favor the Autism Spectrum Disorder group, (3) the strongest group differences under other preprocessing approaches are the ones most altered by Global Signal Regression, and (4) locations showing group differences no longer agree with those showing correlations with behavioral symptoms within the Autism Spectrum Disorder group. The correlation matrices of both participant groups under Global Signal Regression were well predicted by our previous mathematical analyses, demonstrating that there is nothing mysterious about these results. Finally, when independent physiological nuisance measures are lacking, we provide a simple alternative approach for assessing and lessening the infiuence of global correlations on group comparisons that replicates our previous findings. While this alternative performs less well for symptom correlations than our favored preprocessing approach that includes removal of independent physiological measures, it is preferable to the use of Global Signal Regression, which prevents unequivocal conclusions about the direction or location of group differences. © 2013 Gotts, Saad, Jo, Wallace, Cox and Martin.},\n",

      "abstract={Typical adults show an inverse relation between callosal fiber length and degree of interhemispheric connectivity. This has been hypothesized to be a consequence of the influence of conduction delays and cellular costs during development on axonal pruning, both of which increase with fiber length. Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) provides a test of this hypothesis: Children with ASD are known to have enlarged brains; thus, adults with ASD should show reductions in interhemispheric connectivity proportional to their degree of brain overgrowth during development. This prediction was tested by assessing the relation between both the size and structure of the corpus callosum and callosal fiber length, adjusting for intracranial volume, which is thought to reflect maximum brain size achieved during development. Using tractography to estimate the length of callosal fibers emanating from all areas of cortex, and through which region of the corpus callosum they pass, we show that adults with ASD show an inverse relation between callosal fiber length, adjusted for intracranial volume, and callosum size, and a positive relation between adjusted callosal fiber length and radial diffusivity.

We compared fMRI scans of 15 individuals with Down Syndrome to 14 typically developing control subjects while they viewed 50 min of cartoon video clips. There was widespread increased synchrony between brain regions, with only a small subset of strong, distant connections showing underconnectivity in Down Syndrome. Brain regions showing negative correlations were less anticorrelated and were among the most strongly affected connections in the brain. Increased correlation was observed between all of the distributed brain networks studied, with the strongest internetwork correlation in subjects with the lowest performance IQ. A functional parcellation of the brain showed simplified network structure in Down Syndrome organized by local connectivity. Despite increased interregional synchrony, intersubject correlation to the cartoon stimuli was lower in Down Syndrome, indicating that increased synchrony had a temporal pattern that was not in response to environmental stimuli, but idiosyncratic to each Down Syndrome subject. Short-range, increased synchrony was not observed in a comparison sample of 447 autism vs. 517 control subjects from the Autism Brain Imaging Exchange (ABIDE) collection of resting state fMRI data, and increased internetwork synchrony was only observed between the default mode and attentional networks in autism. These findings suggest immature development of connectivity in Down Syndrome with impaired ability to integrate information from distant brain regions into coherent distributed networks. © 2013 The Authors.

      "abstract={Asperger syndrome (AS) is an Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) characterised by qualitative impairment in the development of emotional and social skills with relative preservation of general intellectual abilities, including verbal language. People with AS may nevertheless show atypical language, including rate and frequency of speech production. We previously observed that abnormalities in grey matter homogeneity (measured with texture analysis of structural MR images) in AS individuals when compared with controls are also correlated with the volume of caudate nucleus. Here, we tested a prediction that these distributed abnormalities in grey matter compromise the functional integrity of brain networks supporting verbal communication skills. We therefore measured the functional connectivity between caudate nucleus and cortex during a functional neuroimaging study of language generation (verbal fluency), applying psycho-physiological interaction (PPI) methods to test specifically for differences attributable to grey matter heterogeneity in AS participants. Furthermore, we used dynamic causal modelling (DCM) to characterise the causal directionality of these differences in interregional connectivity during word production. Our results revealed a diagnosis-dependent influence of grey matter heterogeneity on the functional connectivity of the caudate nuclei with right insula/inferior frontal gyrus and anterior cingulate, respectively with the left superior frontal gyrus and right precuneus. Moreover, causal modelling of interactions between inferior frontal gyri, caudate and precuneus, revealed a reliance on bottom-up (stimulus-driven) connections in AS participants that contrasted with a dominance of top-down (cognitive control) connections from prefrontal cortex observed in control participants. These results provide detailed support for previously hypothesised central disconnectivity in ASD and specify discrete brain network targets for diagnosis and therapy in ASD. © 2013 The Authors.

      "abstract={Brain tissue changes in autism spectrum disorders seem to be rather subtle and widespread than anatomically distinct. Therefore a multimodal, whole brain imaging technique appears to be an appropriate approach to investigate whether alterations in white and gray matter integrity relate to consistent changes in functional resting state connectivity in individuals with high functioning autism (HFA). We applied diffusion tensor imaging (DTI), voxel-based morphometry (VBM) and resting state functional connectivity magnetic resonance imaging (fcMRI) to assess differences in brain structure and function between 12 individuals with HFA (mean age 35.5, SD 11.4, 9 male) and 12 healthy controls (mean age 33.3, SD 9.0, 8 male). Psychological measures of empathy and emotionality were obtained and correlated with the most significant DTI, VBM and fcMRI findings. We found three regions of convergent structural and functional differences between HFA participants and controls. The right temporo-parietal junction area and the left frontal lobe showed decreased fractional anisotropy (FA) values along with decreased functional connectivity and a trend towards decreased gray matter volume. The bilateral superior temporal gyrus displayed significantly decreased functional connectivity that was accompanied by the strongest trend of gray matter volume decrease in the temporal lobe of HFA individuals. FA decrease in the right temporo-parietal region was correlated with psychological measurements of decreased emotionality. In conclusion, our results indicate common sites of structural and functional alterations in higher order association cortex areas and may therefore provide multimodal imaging support to the long-standing hypothesis of autism as a disorder of impaired higher-order multisensory integration. © 2013 Mueller et al.},\n",

Individuals diagnosed with ASD (high-functioning autism or Asperger's disorder) (n = 36 [28 male]; mean age: 26.00 years) and a group of healthy individuals (n = 34 [23 male]; mean age: 26.21 years) (matched for age, gender, and cognitive function) were administered motor cortical TMS paradigms putatively measuring activity at GABAA and GABAB receptors (i.e.; short and long interval paired pulse TMS, cortical silent period). All cortical inhibition paradigms yielded no difference between ASD and control groups. There was, however, evidence for short interval cortical inhibition (SICI) deficits among those ASD participants who had experienced early language delay, suggesting that GABA may be implicated in an ASD subtype. The current findings do not support a broad role for GABA in the neuropathophysiology of ASD, but provide further indication that GABA A could be involved in ASD where there is a delay in language acquisition.

      "abstract={Attempts to explicate the neural abnormalities behind autism spectrum disorders frequently revealed impaired brain connectivity, yet our knowledge is limited about the alterations linked with autistic traits in the non-clinical population. In our study, we aimed at exploring the neural correlates of dimensional autistic traits using a dual approach of diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) and graph theoretical analysis of resting state functional MRI data. Subjects were sampled from a public neuroimaging dataset of healthy volunteers. Inclusion criteria were adult age (age: 18-65), availability of DTI and resting state functional acquisitions and psychological evaluation including the Social Responsiveness Scale (SRS) and Autistic Spectrum Screening Questionnaire (ASSQ). The final subject cohort consisted of 127 neurotypicals. Global brain network structure was described by graph theoretical parameters: global and average local efficiency. Regional topology was characterized by degree and efficiency. We provided measurements for diffusion anisotropy. The association between autistic traits and the neuroimaging findings was studied using a general linear model analysis, controlling for the effects of age, gender and IQ profile. Significant negative correlation was found between the degree and efficiency of the right posterior cingulate cortex and autistic traits, measured by the combination of ASSQ and SRS scores. Autistic phenotype was associated with the decrease of whole-brain local efficiency. Reduction of diffusion anisotropy was found bilaterally in the temporal fusiform and parahippocampal gyri. Numerous models describe the autistic brain connectome to be dominated by reduced long-range connections and excessive short-range fibers. Our finding of decreased efficiency supports this hypothesis although the only prominent effect was seen in the posterior limbic lobe, which is known to act as a connector hub. The neural correlates of the autistic trait in neurotypicals showed only limited similarities to the reported findings in clinical populations with low functioning autism. © 2013 Jakab et al.},\n",

      "abstract={Social brain circuitry has recently been implicated in processing slow, gentle touch targeting a class of slow-conducting, unmyelinated nerves, CT afferents, which are present only in the hairy skin of mammals. Given the importance of such 'affective touch' in social relationships, the current functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) study aimed to replicate the finding of 'social brain' involvement in processing CT-targeted touch and to examine the relationship between the neural response and individuals' social abilities. During an fMRI scan, 19 healthy adults received alternating blocks of slow (CT-optimal) and fast (non-optimal) brushing to the forearm. Relative to fast touch, the slow touch activated contralateral insula, superior temporal sulcus (STS), medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC), orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) and amygdala. Connectivity analyses revealed co-activation of the mPFC, insula and amygdala during slow touch. Additionally, participants' autistic traits negatively correlated with the response to slow touch in the OFC and STS. The current study replicates and extends findings of the involvement of a network of 'social brain' regions in processing CT-targeted affective touch, emphasizing the multimodal nature of this system. Variability in the brain response to such touch illustrates a tight coupling of social behavior and social brain function in typical adults.© The Author (2012).

In particular, in order to comprehend the etiological mechanisms of their characteristic behaviors, great importance should be placed on realizing how the neural networks of individuals with autistic disorders and WS are formed and work. As such, in this paper, cortical network abnormalities, based on data from a variety of research fields, are presented: psychopathological, histopathological, and clinicopathological studies, as well as structural (i.e., morphological) and functional magnetic resonance imaging studies, including functional connectivity analysis. Based on the structure of the network, we propose an etiology for ASD and WS.

      "abstract={People with autism spectrum disorders (ASD) may show unusual reactions to unexpected changes that appear in their environment. Although several studies have highlighted atypical auditory change processing in ASD, little is known in this disorder about the brain processes involved in visual automatic change detection. The present fMRI study was designed to localize brain activity elicited by unexpected visual changing stimuli in adults with ASD compared to controls. Twelve patients with ASD and 17 healthy adults participated in the experiment in which subjects were presented with a visual oddball sequence while performing a concurrent target detection task. Combined results across participants highlight the involvement of both occipital (BA 18/19) and frontal (BA 6/8) regions during visual change detection. However, adults with ASD display greater activity in the bilateral occipital cortex and in the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) associated with smaller activation in the superior and middle frontal gyri than controls. A psychophysiological interaction (PPI) analysis was performed with ACC as the seed region and revealed greater functionally connectivity to sensory regions in ASD than in controls, but less connectivity to prefrontal and orbito-frontal cortices. Thus, compared to controls, larger sensory activation associated with reduced frontal activation was seen in ASD during automatic visual change detection. Atypical psychophysiological interactions between frontal and occipital regions were also found, congruent with the idea of atypical connectivity between these regions in ASD. The atypical involvement of the ACC in visual change detection can be related to abnormalities previously observed in the auditory modality, thus supporting the hypothesis of an altered general mechanism of change detection in patients with ASD that would underlie their unusual reaction to change. © 2013 The Authors.},\n",

In this study thirteen adults with ASD and ten matched neurotypical controls underwent PET. The scores of rating scales for autistic traits, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and neurological soft signs were included in a factorial analysis and correlated with rCBF. Factors corresponding to \"autistic/ADHD traits\", \"sensory-motor integration\" and \"Intelligence/Motor sequencing\" were identified. In the ASD group, positive correlations with CBF were found for \"autistic/ADHD traits\" in caudate bilaterally and the inferior parietal lobule, for \"sensory-motor integration\" in parieto-occipital cortex and for \"Intelligence/Motor sequencing\" in the right temporal cortex. Notably, CBF in the left thalamus correlated negatively with all three factors. Autistic traits and ADHD symptoms were associated with shared neural substrates. The correlation between \"autistic/ADHD traits\" and rCBF in the caudate is possibly associated with the executive impairments and ritualistic/stereotyped behaviors apparent in ASD. Furthermore, sensory-motor deficits were correlated with rCBF in the occipital visual cortex, involved in atypical visual perception in ASD. Various behavioral and neurological symptoms are suggested to converge into the ASD phenotype. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.},\n",

      "abstract={The advent of high-throughput technologies and the concurrent advances in information sciences have led to an explosion in size and complexity of the data sets collected in biological sciences. The biggest challenge today is to assimilate this wealth of information into a conceptual framework that will help us decipher biological functions. A large and complex collection of data, usually called a data cloud, naturally embeds multi-scale characteristics and features, generically termed geometry. Understanding this geometry is the foundation for extracting knowledge from data. We have developed a new methodology, called data cloud geometry-tree (DCG-tree), to resolve this challenge. This new procedure has two main features that are keys to its success. Firstly, it derives from the empirical similarity measurements a hierarchy of clustering configurations that captures the geometric structure of the data. This hierarchy is then transformed into an ultrametric space, which is then represented via an ultrametric tree or a Parisi matrix. Secondly, it has a built-in mechanism for self-correcting clustering membership across different tree levels. We have compared the trees generated with this new algorithm to equivalent trees derived with the standard Hierarchical Clustering method on simulated as well as real data clouds from fMRI brain connectivity studies, cancer genomics, giraffe social networks, and Lewis Carroll's Doublets network. In each of these cases, we have shown that the DCG trees are more robust and less sensitive to measurement errors, and that they provide a better quantification of the multi-scale geometric structures of the data. As such, DCG-tree is an effective tool for analyzing complex biological data sets. © 2013 Fushing et al.},\n",

      "abstract={Structural and functional underconnectivity have been reported for multiple brain regions, functional systems, and white matter tracts in individuals with autism spectrum disorders (ASD). Although recent developments in complex network analysis have established that the brain is a modular network exhibiting small-world properties, network level organization has not been carefully examined in ASD. Here we used resting-state functional MRI (n = 42 ASD, n = 37 typically developing; TD) to show that children and adolescents with ASD display reduced short and long-range connectivity within functional systems (i.e., reduced functional integration) and stronger connectivity between functional systems (i.e., reduced functional segregation), particularly in default and higher-order visual regions. Using graph theoretical methods, we show that pairwise group differences in functional connectivity are reflected in network level reductions in modularity and clustering (local efficiency), but shorter characteristic path lengths (higher global efficiency). Structural networks, generated from diffusion tensor MRI derived fiber tracts (n = 51 ASD, n = 43 TD), displayed lower levels of white matter integrity yet higher numbers of fibers. TD and ASD individuals exhibited similar levels of correlation between raw measures of structural and functional connectivity (n = 35 ASD, n = 35 TD). However, a principal component analysis combining structural and functional network properties revealed that the balance of local and global efficiency between structural and functional networks was reduced in ASD, positively correlated with age, and inversely correlated with ASD symptom severity. Overall, our findings suggest that modeling the brain as a complex network will be highly informative in unraveling the biological basis of ASD and other neuropsychiatric disorders. © 2012 Published by Elsevier Inc.},\n",

However, little is known about the functional connectivity (FC) of the resting brain in 22q11DS and its relationship with social behavior. A seed-based analysis of resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging data was used to investigate FC associated with the posterior cingulate cortex (PCC), in (26) youth with 22qDS and (51) demographically matched controls. Subsequently, the relationship between PCC connectivity and Social Responsiveness Scale (SRS) scores was examined in 22q11DS participants. Relative to 22q11DS participants, controls showed significantly stronger FC between the PCC and other default mode network (DMN) nodes, including the precuneus, precentral gyrus and left frontal pole. 22q11DS patients did not show age-associated FC changes observed in typically developing controls. Increased connectivity between PCC, medial prefrontal regions and the anterior cingulate cortex, was associated with lower SRS scores (i.e. improved social competence) in 22q11DS. DMN integrity may play a key role in social information processing. We observed disrupted DMN connectivity in 22q11DS, paralleling reports from idiopathic autism and schizophrenia. Increased strength of long-range DMN connectivity was associated with improved social functioning in 22q11DS.

      "abstract={The thalamus plays crucial roles in the development and mature functioning of numerous sensorimotor, cognitive and attentional circuits. Currently limited evidence suggests that autism spectrum disorder may be associated with thalamic abnormalities, potentially related to sociocommunicative and other impairments in this disorder. We used functional connectivity magnetic resonance imaging and diffusion tensor imaging probabilistic tractography to study the functional and anatomical integrity of thalamo-cortical connectivity in children and adolescents with autism spectrum disorder and matched typically developing children. For connectivity with five cortical seeds (prefontal, parieto-occipital, motor, somatosensory and temporal), we found evidence of both anatomical and functional underconnectivity. The only exception was functional connectivity with the temporal lobe, which was increased in the autism spectrum disorders group, especially in the right hemisphere. However, this effect was robust only in partial correlation analyses (partialling out time series from other cortical seeds), whereas findings from total correlation analyses suggest that temporo-thalamic overconnectivity in the autism group was only relative to the underconnectivity found for other cortical seeds. We also found evidence of microstructural compromise within the thalamic motor parcel, associated with compromise in tracts between thalamus and motor cortex, suggesting that the thalamus may play a role in motor abnormalities reported in previous autism studies. More generally, a number of correlations of diffusion tensor imaging and functional connectivity magnetic resonance imaging measures with diagnostic and neuropsychological scores indicate involvement of abnormal thalamocortical connectivity in sociocommunicative and cognitive impairments in autism spectrum disorder. © 2013 The Author.},\n",

      "abstract={Compared to healthy controls, individuals with autism spectrum disorders (ASD) have weaker posterior-anterior connectivity that strengthens less with age within the default network, a set of brain structures connected in the absence of a task and likely involved in social function. The serotonin transporter-linked polymorphic region (5-HTTLPR) genotypes that result in lowered serotonin transporter expression are associated with social impairment in ASD. Additionally, in healthy controls, low expressing 5-HTTLPR genotypes are associated with weaker default network connectivity. However, in ASD, the effect of 5-HTTLPR on the default network is unknown. We hypothesized that 5-HTTLPR's influence on posterior-anterior default network connectivity strength as well as on age-related changes in connectivity differs in the ASD group versus controls. Youth with ASD and healthy controls, ages 8-19, underwent a resting fMRI acquisition. Connectivity was calculated by correlating the posterior hub of the default network with all voxels. Triallelic genotype was assessed via PCR and Sanger sequencing. A genotype-by-diagnosis interaction significantly predicted posterior-anterior connectivity, such that low expressing genotypes (S/S, S/LG, LG/LG) were associated with stronger connectivity than high expressing genotypes (L A/LA, S/LA, LA/LG) in the ASD group, but the converse was true for controls. Also, youth with ASD and low expressing genotypes had greater age-related increases in connectivity values compared to those with high expressing genotypes and controls in either genotype group. Our findings suggest that the cascade of events from genetic variation to brain function differs in ASD. Also, low expressing genotypes may represent a subtype within ASD. © 2012 The Authors.

      "abstract={Deficits in facial mimicry have been widely reported in autism. Some studies have suggested that these deficits are restricted to spontaneous mimicry and do not extend to volitional mimicry. We bridge these apparently inconsistent observations by testing the impact of reward value on neural indices of mimicry and how autistic traits modulate this impact. Neutral faces were conditioned with high and low reward. Subsequently, functional connectivity between the ventral striatum (VS) and inferior frontal gyrus (IFG) was measured while neurotypical adults (n = 30) watched happy expressions made by these conditioned faces. We found greater VS-IFG connectivity in response to high reward vs low reward happy faces. This difference was negatively proportional to autistic traits, suggesting that reduced spontaneous mimicry of social stimuli seen in autism, may be related to a failure in the modulation of the mirror system by the reward system rather than a circumscribed deficit in the mirror system. © The Author (2014).

Input from the ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC) regulates amygdala activity. Although previous research has shown abnormal amygdala function in youth with autism spectrum disorders (ASD), no study has examined amygdala habituation in a young sample or whether habituation is related to amygdala connectivity with the vmPFC. Method: Data were analyzed from 32 children and adolescents with ASD and 56 typically developing controls who underwent functional magnetic resonance imaging while performing a gender identification task for faces that were fearful, happy, sad, or neutral. Habituation was tested by comparing amygdala activation to faces during the first half versus the second half of the session. VmPFC-amygdala connectivity was examined through psychophysiologic interaction analysis. Results: Youth with ASD had decreased amygdala habituation to sad and neutral faces compared with controls. Moreover, decreased amygdala habituation correlated with autism severity as measured by the Social Responsiveness Scale. There was a group difference in vmPFC-amygdala connectivity while viewing sad faces, and connectivity predicted amygdala habituation to sad faces in controls. Conclusions: Sustained amygdala activation to faces suggests that repeated face presentations are processed differently in individuals with ASD, which could contribute to social impairments. Abnormal modulation of the amygdala by the vmPFC may play a role in decreased habituation. © 2013 American Academy of Child & Adolescent Psychiatry.},\n",

      "abstract={IMPORTANCE Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) affects 1 in 88 children and is characterized by a complex phenotype, including social, communicative, and sensorimotor deficits. Autism spectrum disorder has been linked with atypical connectivity across multiple brain systems, yet the nature of these differences in young children with the disorder is not well understood. OBJECTIVES To examine connectivity of large-scale brain networks and determine whether specific networks can distinguish children with ASD from typically developing (TD) children and predict symptom severity in children with ASD. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS Case-control study performed at Stanford University School of Medicine of 20 children 7 to 12 years old with ASD and 20 age-, sex-, and IQ-matched TD children. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Between-group differences in intrinsic functional connectivity of large-scale brain networks, performance of a classifier built to discriminate children with ASD from TD children based on specific brain networks, and correlations between brain networks and core symptoms of ASD. RESULTS We observed stronger functional connectivity within several large-scale brain networks in children with ASD compared with TD children. This hyperconnectivity in ASD encompassed salience, default mode, frontotemporal, motor, and visual networks. This hyperconnectivity result was replicated in an independent cohort obtained from publicly available databases. Using maps of each individual's salience network, children with ASD could be discriminated from TD children with a classification accuracy of 78%, with 75% sensitivity and 80% specificity. The salience network showed the highest classification accuracy among all networks examined, and the blood oxygen-level dependent signal in this network predicted restricted and repetitive behavior scores. The classifier discriminated ASD from TD in the independent sample with 83%accuracy, 67%sensitivity, and 100% specificity. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Salience network hyperconnectivitymay be a distinguishing feature in children with ASD. Quantification of brain network connectivity is a step toward developing biomarkers for objectively identifying children with ASD.},\n",

      "abstract={We conceptualize brain plasticity as an intrinsic property of the nervous system enabling rapid adaptation in response to changes in an organism's internal and external environment. In prenatal and early postnatal development, plasticity allows for the formation of organized nervous system circuitry and the establishment of functional networks. As the individual is exposed to various sensory stimuli in the environment, brain plasticity allows for functional and structural adaptation and underlies learning and memory. We argue that the mechanisms of plasticity change over the lifespan with different slopes of change in different individuals. These changes play a key role in the clinical phenotype of neurodevelopmental disorders like autism and schizophrenia and neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimer's disease. Altered plasticity not only can trigger maladaptive cascades and can be the cause of deficits and disability but also offers opportunities for novel therapeutic interventions. In this chapter, we discuss the importance of brain plasticity across the lifespan and how neuroplasticity-based therapies offer promise for disorders with otherwise limited effective treatment. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.},\n",

      "abstract={CNTNAP2 is a gene on chromosome 7 that has shown associations with autism and schizophrenia, and there is evidence that it plays an important role for neuronal synchronization and brain connectivity. In this study, we assessed the relationship between Diffusion Tensor Imaging (DTI), a putative marker of anatomical brain connectivity, and multiple single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) spread out over this large gene. 81 healthy controls and 44 patients with schizophrenia (all Caucasian) underwent DTI and genotyping of 31 SNPs within CNTNAP2. We employed Tract-based Spatial Statistics (TBSS) for inter-subject brain registration and computed average diffusivity values for six major white matter tracts. Analyses of Covariance (ANCOVAs) were computed to test for possible associations with genotypes. The strongest association, which survived rigorous Bonferroni correction, was between rs2710126 genotype and Fractional Anisotropy (FA) in the uncinate fasciculus (p=00003). This anatomical location is particularly interesting given the enriched fronto-temporal expression of CNTNAP2 in the developing brain. For this SNP, no phenotype association has been reported before. There were several further genotype-DTI associations that were nominally significant but did not survive Bonferroni correction, including an association between axial diffusivity in the dorsal cingulum bundle and a region in intron 13 (represented by rs2710102, rs759178, rs2538991), which has previously been reported to be associated with anterior-posterior functional connectivity. We present new evidence about the effects of CNTNAP2 on brain connectivity, whose disruption has been hypothesized to be central to schizophrenia pathophysiology. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.},\n",

Using a modified resting-state paradigm to drive subjects' attention, we provide evidence of a very marked interaction between ASD brain functional connectivity and cognitive state. We show that functional connectivity changes in opposite ways in ASD and typicals as attention shifts from external world towards one's body generated information. Furthermore, ASD subject alter more markedly than typicals their connectivity across cognitive states. Using differences in brain connectivity across conditions, we ranked brain regions according to their classification power. Anterior insula and dorsal-anterior cingulate cortex were the regions that better characterize ASD differences with typical subjects across conditions, and this effect was modulated by ASD severity.

Eight subjects in acute cocaine withdrawal were compared to controls for connectivity in language areas while performing a task involving categorization of words according to semantic and phonological relatedness. Acute withdrawal subjects had significantly less overall connectivity during semantic relatedness, and a trend towards less connectivity during phonological relatedness.

      "abstract={Autism is a highly varied developmental disorder typically characterized by deficits in reciprocal social interaction, difficulties with verbal and nonverbal communication, and restricted interests and repetitive behaviors. Although a wide range of behavioral, pharmacological, and alternative medicine strategies have been reported to ameliorate specific symptoms for some individuals, there is at present no cure for the condition. Nonetheless, among the many incompatible observations about aspects of the development, anatomy, and functionality of the autistic brain, it is widely agreed that it is characterized by widespread aberrant connectivity. Such disordered connectivity, be it increased, decreased, or otherwise compromised, may complicate healthy synchronization and communication among and within different neural circuits, thereby producing abnormal processing of sensory inputs necessary for normal social life. It is widely accepted that the innate properties of brain electrical activity produce pacemaker elements and linked networks that oscillate synchronously or asynchronously, likely reflecting a type of functional connectivity. Using phase coherence in multiple frequency EEG bands as a measure of functional connectivity, studies have shown evidence for both global hypoconnectivity and local hyperconnectivity in individuals with ASD. However, the nature of the brain's experience-dependent structural plasticity suggests that these abnormal patterns may be reversed with the proper type of treatment. Indeed, neurofeedback (NF) training, an intervention based on operant conditioning that results in self-regulation of brain electrical oscillations, has shown promise in addressing marked abnormalities in functional and structural connectivity. It is hypothesized that neurofeedback produces positive behavioral changes in ASD children by normalizing the aberrant connections within and between neural circuits. NF exploits the brain's plasticity to normalize aberrant connectivity patterns apparent in the autistic brain. By grounding this training in known anatomical (e.g., mirror neuron system) and functional markers (e.g., mu rhythms) of autism, NF training holds promise to support current treatments for this complex disorder. The proposed hypothesis specifically states that neurofeedback-induced alpha mu (8-12. Hz) rhythm suppression or desynchronization, a marker of cortical activation, should induce neuroplastic changes and lead to normalization in relevant mirroring networks that have been associated with higher-order social cognition. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.},\n",

      "abstract={Brain connectomics research has rapidly expanded using functional MRI (fMRI) and diffusion-weighted MRI 2 (dwMRI). A common product of these varied analyses is a connectivity matrix (CM). A CM stores the connection strength between any two regions (\"nodes\") in a brain network. This format is useful for several reasons: 1) it is highly distilled, with minimal data size and complexity, 2) graph theory can be applied to characterize the network's topology, and 3) it retains sufficient information to capture individual differences such as age, gender, intelligence quotient, or disease state. Here we introduce the UCLA Multimodal Connectivity Database (http://umcd.humanconnectomeproject.org), an openly available website for brain network analysis and data sharing. The site is a repository for researchers to publicly share CMs derived from their data. The site also allows users to select any CM shared by another user, compute graph theoretical metrics on the site, visualize a report of results, or download the raw CM. To date, users have contributed over 2000 individual CMs, spanning different imaging modalities (fMRI, dwMRI) and disorders (Alzheimer's, autism, Attention Deficit Hyperactive Disorder). To demonstrate the site's functionality, whole brain functional and structural connectivity matrices are derived from 60 subjects' (ages 26-45) resting state fMRI (rs-fMRI) and dwMRI data and uploaded to the site. The site is utilized to derive graph theory global and regional measures for the rs-fMRI and dwMRI networks. Global and nodal graph theoretical measures between functional and structural networks exhibit low correspondence. This example demonstrates how this tool can enhance the comparability of brain networks from different imaging modalities and studies. The existence of this connectivity-based repository should foster broader data sharing and enable larger-scale meta analyses comparing networks across imaging modality, age group, and disease state. © 2012 Brown, Rudie, Bandrowski, Van_horn and Bookheimer.},\n",

However, developmental changes in white matter microstructure are poorly understood. We used a cross-sectional design to determine whether white matter abnormalities measured using diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) were present in adolescents and adults with ASD and whether age-related changes in white matter microstructure differed between ASD and typically developing (TD) individuals. Participants included 28 individuals with ASD and 33 TD controls matched on age and IQ and assessed at one time point. Widespread decreased fractional anisotropy (FA), and increased radial diffusivity (RaD) and mean diffusivity (MD) were observed in the ASD group compared to the TD group. In addition, significant group-by-age interactions were observed in FA, RaD, and MD in all major tracts except the brain stem, indicating that age-related changes in white matter microstructure differed between the groups. We propose that white matter microstructural changes in ASD may reflect myelination and/or other structural differences including differences in axonal density/arborization. In addition, we suggest that white matter microstuctural impairments may be normalizing during young adulthood in ASD.

This may make it difficult for their partners during face to face communication with them. To elucidate the neural substrates of live inter-subject interaction of ASD patients and normal subjects, we conducted hyper-scanning functional MRI with 21 subjects with autistic spectrum disorder (ASD) paired with typically-developed (normal) subjects, and with 19 pairs of normal subjects as a control. Baseline EC was maintained while subjects performed real-time joint-attention task. The task-related effects were modeled out, and inter-individual correlation analysis was performed on the residual time-course data. ASD-Normal pairs were less accurate at detecting gaze direction than Normal-Normal pairs. Performance was impaired both in ASD subjects and in their normal partners. The left occipital pole (OP) activation by gaze processing was reduced in ASD subjects, suggesting that deterioration of eye-cue detection in ASD is related to impairment of early visual processing of gaze. On the other hand, their normal partners showed greater activity in the bilateral occipital cortex and the right prefrontal area, indicating a compensatory workload. Inter-brain coherence in the right IFG that was observed in the Normal-Normal pairs (Saito et al., 2010) during EC diminished in ASD-Normal pairs. Intra-brain functional connectivity between the right IFG and right superior temporal sulcus (STS) in normal subjects paired with ASD subjects was reduced compared with in Normal-Normal pairs. This functional connectivity was positively correlated with performance of the normal partners on the eye-cue detection. Considering the integrative role of the right STS in gaze processing, inter-subject synchronization during EC may be a prerequisite for eye cue detection by the normal partner.},\n",

Here, we present evidence of one such characteristic: poor evoked response reliability. We compared cortical response amplitude and reliability (consistency across trials) in visual, auditory, and somatosensory cortices of high-functioning individuals with autism and controls. Mean response amplitudes were statistically indistinguishable across groups, yet trial-by-trial response reliability was significantly weaker in autism, yielding smaller signal-to-noise ratios in all sensory systems. Response reliability differences were evident only in evoked cortical responses and not in ongoing resting-state activity. These findings reveal that abnormally unreliable cortical responses, even to elementary nonsocial sensory stimuli, may represent a fundamental physiological alteration of neural processing in autism. The results motivate a critical expansion of autism research to determine whether (and how) basic neural processing properties such as reliability, plasticity, and adaptation/habituation are altered in autism.},\n",

MET risk genotype predicted atypical fMRI activation and deactivation patterns to social stimuli (i.e., emotional faces), as well as reduced functional and structural connectivity in temporo-parietal regions known to have high MET expression, particularly within the default mode network.

      "abstract={Understanding the brain abnormalities present in autistic patients has evolved considerably since the advent of MRI and functional imaging. Recent techniques for acquiring and processing images allow a fine analysis of anatomical, functional and statistical processing of the images. Currently, studies converge to establish the existence of anatomic and functional abnormalities in areas of \" social brain\" in autism. First, the visual analysis of brain MR images of a group of autistic children showed the presence of abnormalities mainly localized in the temporal lobe. On the other hand, statistical analyzes show a decrease in gray matter in regions of the \" social brain\" in individuals with autism compared to a group of controls. Functional studies (PET scan) show a decrease in cerebral blood flow at rest in the same regions in patients. Hypo-activation in the area specialized in the treatment of the human voice in the superior temporal sulcus in patients is also described, but also the hypo-activation of brain regions involved in more complex tasks of social cognition. Abnormalities of the anatomical and functional connectivity between frontal and temporal regions have been highlighted in several studies. Finally, very recent studies concerned with the \" default brain network\" suggest functional alterations of this circuit in this disorder. These areas (social brain, default brain network) are involved in processing stimuli necessary for social and emotional life. The abnormalities found may thus partly explain the profound abnormalities in social behavior in individuals with autism. © 2012.},\n",

      "abstract={Previous studies have suggested atypically enhanced activity of visual cortex during language processing in autism spectrum disorder (ASD). However, it remains unclear whether visual cortical participation reflects isolated processing within posterior regions or functional cooperation with distal brain regions, such as left inferior frontal gyrus (LIFG). We addressed this question using functional connectivity MRI (fcMRI) and structural equation modeling in 14 adolescents and adults with ASD and 14 matched typically developing (TD) participants. Data were analyzed to isolate low-frequency intrinsic fluctuations, by regressing out effects of a semantic decision task. For a right extrastriate seed derived from the strongest cluster of atypical activation in the ASD group, widespread effects of increased connectivity in prefrontal and medial frontal lobes bilaterally were observed for the ASD group, compared to the TD group. A second analysis for a seed in LIFG, derived from pooled activation effects in both groups, also yielded widespread effects of overconnectivity in the ASD group, especially in temporal lobes. Structural equation modeling showed that whereas right extrastriate cortex did not impact function of language regions (left and right IFG, left middle temporal gyrus) in the TD model, it was an integral part of a language circuit in the ASD group. These results suggest that atypical extrastriate activation during language processing in ASD reflects integrative (not isolated) processing. Furthermore, our findings are inconsistent with previous reports of functional underconnectivity in ASD, probably related to removal of task effects required to isolate intrinsic low-frequency fluctuations. © 2012 Elsevier Inc.},\n",

METHOD. We measured skin conductance (SC) at rest and in response to auditory stimuli as well as behavioral responses using the Sensory Processing Measure (SPM) Home Form. Participants were 25 children with ASD and 25 typically developing (TD) children, aged 5-12 yr. RESULTS. The ASD group had significantly higher resting SC and stronger SC reactivity to tones than the TD group. Correlations between SC and SPM indicated that more severe auditory behavioral difficulties were associated with higher sympathetic activation at rest and stronger sympathetic reactivity to sound. CONCLUSION. High sympathetic reactivity to sound may underlie the difficult behavioral responses to sound that children with ASD often demonstrate.},\n",

Method: We examined regional eyes-closed and eyes-open EEG alpha power and coherence at rest in relation to self-reported perceptual and social behavior in 15 adults diagnosed with ASD and a matched comparison group of 16 unimpaired adults. Results: The groups did not differ on eyes-closed EEG alpha power or coherence, but adults with ASD showed less alpha suppression for the eyes-open condition than did controls. In the ASD group, preferential attention to detail (perceptual domain) was associated with lower levels of alpha activity and reduced coherence in posterior regions. No relations between social interaction difficulties (social domain) and alpha measures were found for either group alone. Conclusions: These relations suggest that the processing of perceptual details may be carried out by relatively less synchronized neuronal units in adults with ASD, and may be relatively automatic.

      "abstract={Individuals with autism spectrum condition (ASC) are known to excel in some perceptual cognitive tasks, but such developed functions have been often regarded as \"islets of abilities\" that do not significantly contribute to broader intellectual capacities. However, recent behavioral studies have reported that individuals with ASC have advantages for performing Raven's (Standard) Progressive Matrices (RPM/RSPM), a standard neuropsychological test for general fluid intelligence, raising the possibility that ASC′s cognitive strength can be utilized for more general purposes like novel problem solving. Here, the brain activity of 25 adults with high-functioning ASC and 26 matched normal controls (NC) was measured using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to examine neural substrates of geometric reasoning during the engagement of a modified version of the RSPM test. Among the frontal and parietal brain regions involved in fluid intelligence, ASC showed larger activation in the left lateral occipitotemporal cortex (LOTC) during an analytic condition with moderate difficulty than NC. Activation in the left LOTC and ventrolateral prefrontal cortex (VLPFC) increased with task difficulty in NC, whereas such modulation of activity was absent in ASC. Furthermore, functional connectivity analysis revealed a significant reduction of activation coupling between the left inferior parietal cortex and the right anterior prefrontal cortex during both figural and analytic conditions in ASC. These results indicate altered pattern of functional specialization and integration in the neural system for geometric reasoning in ASC, which may explain its atypical cognitive pattern, including performance on the Raven's Matrices test. © 2012 Yamada et al.},\n",

However, the neural correlates of this dysfunction remain unidentified. Because this dysfunction is manifested in real-life situations, we hypothesized that the observation of dynamic, compared with static, facial expressions would reveal abnormal brain functioning in individuals with ASD.We presented dynamic and static facial expressions of fear and happiness to individuals with high-functioning ASD and to age- and sex-matched typically developing controls and recorded their brain activities using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI).Result: Regional analysis revealed reduced activation of several brain regions in the ASD group compared with controls in response to dynamic versus static facial expressions, including the middle temporal gyrus (MTG), fusiform gyrus, amygdala, medial prefrontal cortex, and inferior frontal gyrus (IFG). Dynamic causal modeling analyses revealed that bi-directional effective connectivity involving the primary visual cortex-MTG-IFG circuit was enhanced in response to dynamic as compared with static facial expressions in the control group. Group comparisons revealed that all these modulatory effects were weaker in the ASD group than in the control group.Conclusions: These results suggest that weak activity and connectivity of the social brain network underlie the impairment in social interaction involving dynamic facial expressions in individuals with ASD. © 2012 Sato et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.},\n",

      "abstract={Affective empathy (AE) is distinguished clinically and neurally from cognitive empathy (CE). While AE is selectively disrupted in psychopathy, autism is associated with deficits in CE. Despite such dissociations, AE and CE together contribute to normal human empathic experience. A dimensional measure of individual differences in AE 'relative to' CE captures this interaction and may reveal brain-behavior relationships beyond those detectable with AE and CE separately. Using resting-state fMRI and measures of empathy in healthy adults, we show that relative empathic ability (REA) is reflected in the brain's intrinsic functional dynamics. Dominance of AE was associated with stronger functional connectivity among social-emotional regions (ventral anterior insula, orbitofrontal cortex, amygdala, perigenual anterior cingulate). Dominance of CE was related to stronger connectivity among areas implicated in interoception, autonomic monitoring and social-cognitive processing (brainstem, superior temporal sulcus, ventral anterior insula). These patterns were distinct from those observed with AE and CE separately. Finally, REA and the strength of several functional connections were associated with symptoms of psychopathology. These findings suggest that REA provides a dimensional index of empathic function and pathological tendencies in healthy adults, which are reflected in the intrinsic functional dynamics of neural systems associated with social and emotional cognition. © The Author (2011).

Methods: High-resolution magnetic resonance (MR) imaging, J-resolved MR spectroscopy, and diffusion tensor imaging data were acquired during a single scanning session for a 63-year-old male autistic savant with prodigious artistic skills. Regional and compartmental brain volumes, N-acetyl aspartate, choline, creatine, glutamate and γ-aminobutyric acid concentrations, fractional anisotropy values, and white matter bundle volumes as well as axial, radial, and mean diffusivities were calculated. Results: No gross anatomical differences were observed. By morphological assessment, cerebral volume (1362 mL) was larger than normative literature values for adult males. The corpus callosum was intact and did not exhibit abnormal structural features. The right cerebral hemisphere was 1.9% larger than the left hemisphere; the right amygdala and right caudate nuclei were 24% and 9.9% larger, respectively, compared with the left side. In contrast, the putamen was 8.3% larger on the left side. Fractional anisotropy was increased on the right side as compared with the left for 4 of the 5 bilateral regions studied (the amygdala, caudate, frontal lobe, and hippocampus). Fiber tract bundle volumes were larger on the right side for the amygdala, hippocampus, frontal lobe, and occipital lobe. Both the left and the right hippocampi had substantially increased axial and mean diffusivities as compared with those of a comparison sample of nonsavant adult males. The corpus callosum and left amygdala also exhibited high axial, radial, and mean diffusivities. MR spectroscopy revealed markedly decreased γ-aminobutyric acid and glutamate in the parietal lobe. Conclusions: Although examination of brain gross morphometry demonstrated no clinically remarkable abnormalities, utilization of conventional as well as newer MR imaging technologies revealed several atypical structural and chemical features that may be involved in the special skills of this prodigious savant. The multimodal imaging approach presented in this study is suitable for the evaluation of larger samples of savants with a diverse range of talents to investigate common brain features that may underlie the exceptional cognitive capabilities characteristic of savant syndrome. Given the high co-occurrence of the two syndromes, elucidating the underlying neurophysiologic basis of savant syndrome may also lead to a better understanding of autism spectrum disorder. © 2012 Elsevier Inc.},\n",

      "abstract={Recent studies on selective attention have demonstrated that the perceptual load of a task determines the processing stage at which irrelevant sensory stimuli are filtered out. Although individuals with autism spectrum conditions (ASC) have been repeatedly reported to display several kinds of abnormal behavior related to attention deficits, the neural mechanisms underlying these deficits have not been well investigated within the framework of the load dependency of selective attention. The present study used functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to examine the brain responses of adults with high-functioning ASC to irrelevant visual distractors while performing a visual target detection task under high or low perceptual load. We observed that the increased perceptual load activated regions of the fronto-parietal attention network of controls and ASC comparably. On the other hand, the visual cortex activity evoked by visual distractors was less modulated by the increased perceptual load in ASC than in controls. Simple regression analyses showed that the degree of the modulation was significantly correlated with the severity of the autistic symptoms. We also observed reduced load-dependent modulation of the functional connectivity between the intraparietal and visual regions in the ASC group. These results revealed neural correlates for abnormal perceptual load-dependent engagement of visual attention in ASC, which may underlie aspects of cognitive and behavioral characteristics of these disorders. © 2012 Elsevier Inc.},\n",

Three independent studies have found anatomical and resting functional temporal abnormalities. These anomalies are localised to the superior temporal sulci bilaterally, which are critical for perception of key social stimuli. In addition, functional studies have shown hypoactivation of most areas implicated in social perception (face and voice perception) and social cognition (theory of mind).

      "abstract={Current research suggests that autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is characterized by asynchronous neural oscillations. However, it is unclear whether changes in neural oscillations represent an index of the disorder or are shared more broadly among both affected and unaffected family members. Additionally, it remains unclear how early these differences emerge in development and whether they remain constant or change over time. In this study we examined developmental trajectories in spectral power in infants at high- or low-risk for ASD. Spectral power was extracted from resting EEG recorded over frontal regions of the scalp when infants were 6, 9, 12, 18 and 24 months of age. We used multilevel modeling to assess change over time between risk groups in the delta, theta, low alpha, high alpha, beta, and gamma frequency bands. The results indicated that across all bands, spectral power was lower in high-risk infants as compared to low-risk infants at 6-months of age. Furthermore high-risk infants showed different trajectories of change in spectral power in the subsequent developmental window indicating that not only are the patterns of change different, but that group differences are dynamic within the first two years of life. These findings remained the same after removing data from a subset of participants who displayed ASD related behaviors at 24 or 36 months. These differences in the nature of the trajectories of EEG power represent important endophenotypes of ASD. © 2012 Tierney et al.},\n",

      "abstract={A growing body of evidence suggests that autism spectrum disorders (ASDs) are related to altered communication between brain regions. Here, we present findings showing that ASD is characterized by a pattern of reduced functional integration as well as reduced segregation of large-scale brain networks. Twenty-three children with ASD and 25 typically developing matched controls underwent functional magnetic resonance imaging while passively viewing emotional face expressions. We examined whole-brain functional connectivity of two brain structures previously implicated in emotional face processing in autism: the amygdala bilaterally and the right pars opercularis of the inferior frontal gyrus (rIFGpo). In the ASD group, we observed reduced functional integration (i.e., less long-range connectivity) between amygdala and secondary visual areas, as well as reduced segregation between amygdala and dorsolateral prefrontal cortex. For the rIFGpo seed, we observed reduced functional integration with parietal cortex and increased integration with right frontal cortex as well as right nucleus accumbens. Finally, we observed reduced segregation between rIFGpo and the ventromedial prefrontal cortex. We propose that a systems-level approach-whereby the integration and segregation of large-scale brain networks in ASD is examined in relation to typical development-may provide a more detailed characterization of the neural basis of ASD. © 2011 The Author.},\n",

Participants learned to identify liars among pairs of computer-animated avatars uttering the same sentence but with different facial and vocal expressions, namely those that have previously been associated with lying versus truth-telling. Despite showing a behavioral learning effect similar to the control group, the autism group did not show the same pattern of decreased activation in cortical association areas as they learned the task. Furthermore, the autism group showed a significantly smaller increase in interregion synchronization of activation (functional connectivity) with learning than did the control group. Finally, the autism group had decreased structural connectivity as measured by corpus callosum size, and this measure was reliably related to functional connectivity measures. The findings suggest that cortical underconnectivity in autism may constrain the ability of the brain to rapidly adapt during learning. © The Author 2011. Published by Oxford University Press.},\n",

      "abstract={The neural bases of gender differences in emotional, cognitive, and socials behaviors are largely unknown. Here, magnetic resonance imaging data from 336 women and 225 men revealed a gender dimorphism in the functional organization of the brain. Consistently across five research sites, women had 14% higher local functional connectivity density (lFCD) and up to 5% higher gray matter density than men in cortical and subcortical regions. The negative power scaling of the lFCD was steeper for men than for women, suggesting that the balance between strongly and weakly connected nodes in the brain is different across genders. The more distributed organization of the male brain than that of the female brain could help explain the gender differences in cognitive style and behaviors and in the prevalence of neuropsychiatric diseases (i.e., autism spectrum disorder). © 2011 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},\n",

      "abstract={Growing evidence suggests that autistic traits, such as reduced social and communication skills, exist along a continuum between healthy and pathological conditions. Thus, functional and structural investigations of neuroanatomical substrates that significantly correlate with autistic tendency in healthy human subjects are critical for understanding this disorder. To accomplish this goal, we performed functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) in combination with diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) in 30 healthy young subjects. The subjects were evaluated using the Autistic-Spectrum Quotient (AQ), which was designed to measure autistic traits in healthy and autistic spectrum disorder (ASD) subjects. Face-specific brain activation in the superior temporal sulcus (STS) and amygdala (AMG) was identified using fMRI and passive viewing of faces. In addition, probabilistic tractography performed in each subject by using DTI showed a white matter pathway between the face-specific regions of interest in the STS and AMG. The volume of connectivity between the STS and AMG correlated positively with the total AQ score (Spearman's ρ= 0.38, p< 0.05); however, among the AQ subscales, only imagination was significantly associated with the connectivity volume. These results suggest that healthy subjects with high autistic traits may show an increase in the white matter pathway that connects key regions involved in face processing. © 2012 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.},\n",

      "abstract={A fundamental component of brain development is the formation of large-scale networks across the cortex. One such network, the default network, undergoes a protracted development, displaying weak connectivity in childhood that strengthens in adolescence and becomes most robust in adulthood. Little is known about the genetic contributions to default network connectivity in adulthood or during development. Alterations in connectivity between posterior and frontal portions of the default network have been associated with several psychological disorders, including anxiety, autism spectrum disorders, schizophrenia, depression, and attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder. These disorders have also been linked to variants of the serotonin transporter linked polymorphic region (5-HTTLPR). The L A allele of 5-HTTLPR results in higher serotonin transporter expression than the S allele or the rarer L G allele. 5-HTTLPR may influence default network connectivity, as the superior medial frontal region has been shown to be sensitive to changes in serotonin. Also, serotonin as a growth factor early in development may alter large-scale networks such as the default network. The present study examined the influence of 5-HTTLPR variants on connectivity between the posterior and frontal structures and its development in a cross-sectional study of 39 healthy children and adolescents. We found that children and adolescents homozygous for the S allele (S/S, n=10) showed weaker connectivity in the superior medial frontal cortex compared to those homozygous for the L A allele (L A/L A, n=13) or heterozygotes (S/L A, S/L G, n=16). Moreover, there was an age-by-genotype interaction, such that those with L A/L A genotype had the steepest age-related increase in connectivity between the posterior hub and superior medial frontal cortex, followed by heterozygotes. In contrast, individuals with the S/S genotype had the least age-related increase in connectivity strength. This preliminary report expands our understanding of the genetic influences on the development of large-scale brain connectivity and lays down the foundation for future research and replication of the results with a larger sample. © 2011 Elsevier Inc.},\n",

      "abstract={Randomness of functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) resting-state time-series has recently been used as a biomarker for numerous disorders including Alzheimer's and Parkinson's disease as well as autism. To date, however, it remains unknown whether and to what degree personality traits are associated with the randomness of resting-state temporal dynamics. To investigate this question, we estimated the Hurst exponent - a measure of the randomness of a time-series - during resting-state fMRI in brain areas previously associated with trait Impulsivity as defined in Gray's Reinforcement Sensitivity Theory of Personality in 15 healthy individuals. The Hurst exponent in the ventral striatum as well as in the orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) was significantly associated with the measure of Gray's trait Impulsivity. Specifically, more random resting-state neural dynamics corresponded to higher Impulsivity scores both in the ventral striatum (r(15) = -71; p = .003) and the OFC (r(15) = -81; p < .001). In summary, we provide evidence for an association between individual differences in Gray's Impulsivity and randomness in key areas of the reward system which have previously been associated with this personality trait. Based on evidence from fMRI and electroencephalographical studies, we suggest that this association might arise from resting-state fluctuations constraining task-related neural responsiveness. Thereby, we outline a potential mechanism linking randomness of resting-state dynamics and personality. © 2011 Elsevier Inc.},\n",

      "abstract={Whether people with Autism Spectrum Disorders (ASDs) have a specific deficit when processing biological motion has been a topic of much debate. We used psychophysical methods to determine individual behavioural thresholds in a point-light direction discrimination paradigm for a small but carefully matched groups of adults (N = 10 per group) with and without ASDs. These thresholds were used to derive individual stimulus levels in an identical fMRI task, with the purpose of equalising task performance across all participants whilst inside the scanner. The results of this investigation show that despite comparable behavioural performance both inside and outside the scanner, the group with ASDs shows a different pattern of BOLD activation from the TD group in response to the same stimulus levels. Furthermore, connectivity analysis suggests that the main differences between the groups are that the TD group utilise a unitary network with information passing from temporal to parietal regions, whilst the ASD group utilise two distinct networks; one utilising motion sensitive areas and another utilising form selective areas. Furthermore, a temporal-parietal link that is present in the TD group is missing in the ASD group. We tentatively propose that these differences may occur due to early dysfunctional connectivity in the brains of people with ASDs, which to some extent is compensated for by rewiring in high functioning adults. © 2011 Elsevier Inc.},\n",

      "abstract={Autism spectrum disorders are developmental disorders characterized by impairments in social and communication abilities and repetitive behaviours. Converging neuroscientific evidence has suggested that the neuropathology of autism spectrum disorders is widely distributed, involving impaired connectivity throughout the brain. Here, we evaluate the hypothesis that decreased connectivity in high-functioning adolescents with an autism spectrum disorder relative to typically developing adolescents is concentrated within domain-specific circuits that are specialized for social processing. Using a novel whole-brain connectivity approach in functional magnetic resonance imaging, we found that not only are decreases in connectivity most pronounced between regions of the social brain but also they are selective to connections between limbic-related brain regions involved in affective aspects of social processing from other parts of the social brain that support language and sensorimotor processes. This selective pattern was independently obtained for correlations with measures of social symptom severity, implying a fractionation of the social brain in autism spectrum disorders at the level of whole circuits. © 2012 The Author.

Paradoxically, brain regions associated with these functions typically overlap, enabling investigation of neural organization supporting speech and song in autism. Neural systems sensitive to speech and song were compared in low-functioning autistic and age-matched control children using passive auditory stimulation during functional magnetic resonance and diffusion tensor imaging. Activation in left inferior frontal gyrus was reduced in autistic children relative to controls during speech stimulation, but was greater than controls during song stimulation. Functional connectivity for song relative to speech was also increased between left inferior frontal gyrus and superior temporal gyrus in autism, and large-scale connectivity showed increased frontal-posterior connections. Although fractional anisotropy of the left arcuate fasciculus was decreased in autistic children relative to controls, structural terminations of the arcuate fasciculus in inferior frontal gyrus were indistinguishable between autistic and control groups. Fractional anisotropy correlated with activity in left inferior frontal gyrus for both speech and song conditions. Together, these findings indicate that in autism, functional systems that process speech and song were more effectively engaged for song than for speech and projections of structural pathways associated with these functions were not distinguishable from controls. © The Author (2012).},\n",

      "abstract={Pictures created spontaneously by patients with brain disease often display impaired or diminished artistry, reflecting the patient's cerebral damage. This article explores the opposite: those pictures created in the face of brain disease that show enhanced or enduring artistry, and those that emerge for the first time in artistically naïve patients. After comments on background issues relating to the patient and the viewer, the paintings and drawings are considered in relation to the heterogeneous conditions in which this artistic creativity is seen. These conditions include various dementias-most notably frontotemporal lobar dementia, stroke, Parkinson's disease, autism and related disorders and psychiatric disease, epilepsy, migraine and trauma. In the discussion, it is argued that evidence of underlying brain dysfunction revealed by these pictures often rests on the abnormal context in which the pictures are created, or on changes in artistry demonstrated by a sequence of pictures. In the former, the compulsive element and sensory and emotional accompaniments are often important features; in the latter, evolving changes are evident, and have included depiction of increasing menace in portrayal of faces. The occurrence of synaesthesia, and its relation to creativity, are briefly discussed in respect of two unusual patients, followed by considering the role of the anterior and frontal lobes, mesolimbic connections and the right hemisphere. In at least some patients, impaired inhibition leading to paradoxical functional facilitation, with compensatory changes particularly in the right posterior hemisphere, is likely to be pivotal in enabling unusual artistry to emerge; preservation of language, however, is not a prerequisite. Many patients studied have been artists, and it appears possible that some of those with an artistic predisposition may be more likely to experience pathologically obsessive creativity. The discussion concludes that occasionally pictures created by these rare individuals unexpectedly prove to be an invaluable but little studied tool for investigating the dysfunctioning brain. © 2012 The Author.},\n",

Here, we scanned 328 young adults with high-field (4-Tesla) diffusion imaging, to test the hypothesis that carriers of this gene variant would have altered structural brain connectivity. All participants (209 women, 119 men, age: 23.4±2.17 SD years) were scanned with 105-gradient high-angular-resolution diffusion imaging (HARDI) at 4 Tesla. After performing a whole-brain fiber tractography using the full angular resolution of the diffusion scans, 70 cortical surface-based regions of interest were created from each individual's co-registered anatomical data to compute graph metrics for all pairs of cortical regions. In graph theory analyses, subjects homozygous for the risk allele (CC) had lower characteristic path length, greater small-worldness and global efficiency in whole-brain analyses, and lower eccentricity (maximum path length) in 60 of the 70 nodes in regional analyses. These results were not reducible to differences in more commonly studied traits such as fiber density or fractional anisotropy. This is the first study that links graph theory metrics of brain structural connectivity to a common genetic variant linked with autism and will help us understand the neurobiology of the circuits implicated in the risk for autism. © 2011, Mary Ann Liebert, Inc.

Data are drawn from my current New York-based study in a laboratory conducting fMRI research on resting-state differences amongst controls and children variously diagnosed with attention deficit hyper-activity disorder (ADHD), learning disabilities, autism and Tourette syndrome. Parents of children with those same diagnoses struggle with the strengths as well as the school-based weaknesses of their children, and in interviews they picture their children's brains quite differently than do the scientists. Young adult activists who grew up with the diagnoses of ADHD and learning disabilities appropriate lab-based descriptions of neurological difference to their own purposes, claiming a positive identity forthemselves.

      "abstract={Non-associative learning is a basic neuroadaptive behavior exhibited in almost all animal species and sensory modalities but its functions and mechanisms in the mammalian brain are poorly understood. Previous studies have identified two distinct forms of non-associative learning in the classic Hering-Breuer inflation reflex (HBIR) induced apnea in rats: NMDA receptor (NMDAR)-independent habituation in a primary vagal pathway and NMDAR-dependent desensitization in a secondary pontine pathway. Here, we show that abnormal non-associative learning of the HBIR may underlie the endophenotypic tachypnea in an animal model of Rett syndrome (RTT), an autism-spectrum disorder caused by mutations in the X-linked gene encoding methyl-CpG-binding protein 2 (MECP2). Mecp2+/- symptomatic mice on a mixed-strain background demonstrated significantly increased resting respiratory frequency with shortened expiration and normal inspiratory duration compared with asymptomatic mutants and wild-type controls, a phenotype that is characteristic of girls with RTT. Low-intensity electrical stimulation of the vagus nerve elicited fictive HBIR with time-dependent habituation in both Mecp2+/- and wild-type mice. However, time-dependent desensitization of the HBIR was evidenced only in wild-type controls and asymptomatic mutant mice but was absent or suppressed in Mecp2+/- symptomatic mice or in wild-type mice after blockade of NMDAR with dizocilpine. Remarkably, ~50% of the Mecp2+/- mice developed these X-linked phenotypes despite somatic mosaicism. Such RTT-like respiratory endophenotypes in mixed-strain Mecp2+/- mice differed from those previously reported in Mecp2-/y mice on pure C57BL/6J background. These findings provide the first evidence indicating that impaired NMDAR-dependent desensitization of the HBIR may contribute to the endophenotypic tachypnea in RTT. © 2011 Song, Tin, Giacometti and Poon.},\n",

Recent studies have demonstrated activity-dependent regulation of the AIS, including homeostatic changes in AIS length, membrane excitability, and the localization of voltage-gated Na + channels. The neurodevelopmental disorder Angelman syndrome (AS) is usually caused by the deletion of small portions of the maternal copy of chromosome 15, which includes the UBE3A gene. A mouse model of AS has been generated and these mice exhibit multiple neurological abnormalities similar to those observed in humans.Weexamined intrinsic properties of pyramidal neurons in hippocampal area CA1 from AS model mice and observed alterations in resting membrane potential, threshold potential, and action potential amplitude. The altered intrinsic properties in the AS mice were correlated with significant increases in the expression of the α1 subunit of Na/K-ATPase (α 1-NaKA), the Na + channel NaV1.6, and the AIS anchoring protein ankyrin-G, as well as an increase in length of the AIS. These findings are the first evidence for pathology of intrinsic membrane properties and AIS-specific changes in AS, a neurodevelopmental disorder associated with autism. © 2011 the authors.},\n",

      "abstract={Purpose: Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) has been studied as a neurodevelopmental disorder since Leo Kanner's early observations of abnormal head circumference in autistic children. In the past few years, there has been much progress made in elucidating the anatomical and functional abnormalities in ASD. This paper aims to summarise the extant research. Design/methodology/approach: This paper provides a summary of relevant research findings in the neuroimaging of autism for the past 12 month period. Papers were identified using the Medline search terms: autism; ASD (functional); magnetic resonance imaging (MRI); neuroimaging; diffusion tensor imaging (DTI); and endophenotype. Findings: Relatively recent techniques such as functional MRI and DTI have furthered the initial work derived from early histological and structural imaging studies. Even newer techniques, such as DTI tractography and support vector machine analysis, and other computer-based learning methods have allowed us to move beyond regional variations in grey and white matter volume and study ASD as a disorder of connectivity, and of regional cerebral function and neural circuitry. Brain regions and neural circuits that are implicated in the core symptoms of ASD (deficits in social reciprocity, language and communication, and restricted and stereotyped interests) have been repeatedly shown to be abnormal in those individuals. Originality/value: This paper aims to provide a background for clinicians to the current research and focuses on developments in the field of neuroimaging of ASD from the past year, which have generated further insights into the neurobiology of ASD. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.},\n",

      "abstract={Brain plasticity can be conceptualized as nature's invention to overcome limitations of the genome and adapt to a rapidly changing environment. As such, plasticity is an intrinsic property of the brain across the lifespan. However, mechanisms of plasticity may vary with age. The combination of transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) with electroencephalography (EEG) or functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) enables clinicians and researchers to directly study local and network cortical plasticity, in humans in vivo, and characterize their changes across the age-span. Parallel, translational studies in animals can provide mechanistic insights. Here, we argue that, for each individual, the efficiency of neuronal plasticity declines throughout the age-span and may do so more or less prominently depending on variable 'starting-points' and different 'slopes of change' defined by genetic, biological, and environmental factors. Furthermore, aberrant, excessive, insufficient, or mistimed plasticity may represent the proximal pathogenic cause of neurodevelopmental and neurodegenerative disorders such as autism spectrum disorders or Alzheimer's disease. © Springer Science+Business Media, LLC 2011.},\n",

      "abstract={Background: Socio-communicative impairments are salient features of autism spectrum disorder (ASD). Abnormal development of posterior superior temporal sulcus (pSTS)-a key processing area for language, biological motion, and social context-could play a role in these deficits. Methods: Functional connectivity magnetic resonance imaging was used to examine the synchronization of low-frequency blood oxygen level-dependent fluctuations during continuous performance on a visual search task. Twenty-one children and adolescents with ASD and 26 typically developing individuals-matched on age and IQ-participated in the study. Three subregions of pSTS were delineated with a data-driven approach, and differentiation of pSTS was examined by comparing the connectivity of each subregion. Results: In typically developing individuals, differentiation of networks was positively associated with age and anatomical maturation (cortical thinning in pSTS, greater white matter volume). In the ASD group, differentiation of pSTS connectivity was significantly reduced, and correlations with anatomical measures were weak or absent. Moreover, pSTS differentiation was inversely correlated with autism symptom severity. Conclusions: Atypical maturation of pSTS suggests altered trajectories for functional segregation and integration of networks in ASD, potentially related to impaired cognitive and sensorimotor development. Furthermore, our findings provide a novel explanation for atypically increased connectivity in ASD that has been observed in some functional connectivity magnetic resonance imaging studies. © 2011 Society of Biological Psychiatry.},\n",

      "abstract={Individual differences in the expression of autism complicate research on the nature and treatment of this disorder. In the Modifier Model of Autism (Mundy et al. 2007), we proposed that individual differences in autism may result not only from syndrome specific causal processes, but also from variability in generic, non-syndrome specific modifier processes that affect the social and emotional development of all people. One study supporting this model found that measures of resting anterior EEG asymmetry, a measure reflecting complex brain processes associated with generic individual differences in approach and avoidance motivation, may help explain differences in the expression of autism in children without intellectual disabilities (Sutton et al. 2005). In the current study, we partially replicated the observation that children with autism who exhibited a pattern of left frontal EEG asymmetry tended to display milder levels of social symptoms, although in the current sample this pattern applied only to HFA children with relatively lower verbal IQs. New observations indicated that left frontal EEG asymmetry was also associated with retrospective parent reports of significantly later age of onset of symptoms, but also higher levels of self-reported outward expressions of anger as well as symptoms of obsessive compulsive disorder in school-age higher functioning children with ASD. Therefore, the results of this study provide a new and fully independent set of observations, which indicate that individual differences in anterior EEG asymmetry may significantly moderate the expression and developmental course of autism. This observation may have clinical implications for identifying meaningful diagnostic sub-groups among children with autism. © 2010 The Author(s).},\n",

      "abstract={Impaired understanding of others' sensations and emotions as well as abnormal experience of their own emotions and sensations is frequently reported in individuals with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD). It is hypothesized that these abnormalities are based on altered connectivity within \"shared\" neural networks involved in emotional awareness of self and others. The insula is considered a central brain region in a network underlying these functions, being located at the transition of information about bodily arousal and the physiological state of the body to subjective feelings. The present study investigated the intrinsic functional connectivity properties of the insula in 14 high-functioning participants with ASD (HF-ASD) and 15 typically developing (TD) participants in the age range between 12 and 20 years by means of \"resting state\" or \"nontask\" functional magnetic resonance imaging. Essentially, a distinction was made between anterior and posterior regions of the insular cortex. The results show a reduced functional connectivity in the HF-ASD group, compared with the TD group, between anterior as well as posterior insula and specific brain regions involved in emotional and sensory processing. It is suggested that functional abnormalities in a network involved in emotional and interoceptive awareness might be at the basis of altered emotional experiences and impaired social abilities in ASD, and that these abnormalities are partly based on the intrinsic functional connectivity properties of such a network. © 2010 Wiley-Liss, Inc.},\n",

To this end, we used comparable experiences of social exclusion and rule violation to probe potentially atypical neural networks in ASD. In children and adolescents with and without ASD, we used the interactive ball-toss game (Cyberball) to elicit social exclusion and a comparable game (Cybershape) to elicit a non-exclusive rule violation. Using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), we identified group differences in brain responses to social exclusion and rule violation. Though both groups reported equal distress following exclusion, the right insula and ventral anterior cingulate cortex were hypoactive during exclusion in children with ASD. In rule violation, right insula and dorsal prefrontal cortex were hyperactive in ASD. Right insula showed a dissociation in activation; it was hypoactive to social exclusion and hyperactive to rule violation in the ASD group. Further probed, different regions of right insula were modulated in each game, highlighting differences in regional specificity for which subsequent analyses revealed differences in patterns of functional connectivity. These results demonstrate neurobiological differences in processing social exclusion and rule violation in children with ASD. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},\n",

Method: Participants were 155 boys with AD/HD and 109 age- and gender-matched controls. EEG was recorded during an eyes-closed resting condition and Fourier transformed to provide estimates for total power, and relative delta, theta, alpha, and beta. EEG data were grouped into 3 regions, and subjected to Cluster Analysis. Behavioural data for each cluster were compared against the remaining AD/HD subjects. Results: Four EEG clusters were found. These were characterised by (a) elevated beta activity, (b) elevated theta with deficiencies of alpha and beta, (c) elevated slow wave with less fast wave activity, and (d) elevated alpha. An exploratory analysis of behavioural correlates with these EEG subtypes indicated the presence of interesting trends that need further investigation. Conclusions: This study found that the AD/HD EEG profiles reported in past studies are robust and not substantially affected by the inclusion of children with other comorbid conditions. The observed group differences in behavioural profiles indicated that different patterns of EEG activity have importance in determining behaviour. Significance: This is the first study to link behavioural profiles of children with AD/HD to specific EEG abnormalities. © 2010 International Federation of Clinical Neurophysiology.},\n",

      "abstract={Previous behavioral studies have shown that individuals with autism are less hindered by interference from global processing during the performance of lower-level perceptual tasks, such as finding embedded figures. The primary goal of this study was to examine the brain manifestation of such atypicality in high-functioning autism using fMRI. Fifteen participants with high-functioning autism and fifteen age- and IQ-matched typical controls were asked to perform a lower-level perceptual line-counting task in the presence of a distracting depiction of a 3-D object, in which participants counted whether there were more red or more green contours (In a contrasting 3-D task, participants judged whether the same 3-D stimulus objects (but without color in any contours) depicted a possible or impossible 3-D object). We hypothesized that individuals with autism would be less likely than controls to process the global 3-D information (and would hence show fewer neural signs of such interfering 3-D processing) during the lower-level line-counting task. The fMRI results revealed that in the line-counting task, the autism group did not show the increased medial frontal activity (relative to the possibility task), or the increased functional connectivity between the medial frontal region and posterior visual-spatial regions, demonstrated by the control group. Both findings are indices of lesser effort and difficulty in the line-counting task for the autism group than for the control group, attributed to less interference from the 3-D processing in the autism group. In addition, in the line-counting task, the control group showed a positive correlation between a measure of spatial ability (Vandenberg scores) and activation in the medial frontal region, suggesting that more spatially able control participants did more suppression of the irrelevant 3-D background information in order to focus on the line-counting task. The findings collectively indicate that the global 3-D structure of the figure had a smaller effect, if any, on local processing in the group with autism compared to the control group. The results from this study provide the first direct neural evidence of reduced global-to-local interference in autism. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.},\n",

      "abstract={The amygdala plays an important role in emotional and social functions, and amygdala dysfunction has been associated with multiple neuropsychiatric disorders, including autism, anxiety, and depression. Although the amygdala is composed of multiple anatomically and functionally distinct nuclei, typical structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) sequences are unable to discern them. Thus, functional MRI (fMRI) studies typically average the BOLD response over the entire structure, which reveals some aspects of amygdala function as a whole but does not distinguish the separate roles of specific nuclei in humans. We developed a method to segment the human amygdala into its four major nuclei using only diffusion-weighted imaging and connectivity patterns derived mainly from animal studies. We refer to this new method as Tractography-based Segmentation, or TractSeg. The segmentations derived from TractSeg were topographically similar to their corresponding amygdaloid nuclei, and were validated against a high-resolution scan in which the nucleic boundaries were visible. In addition, nuclei topography was consistent across subjects. TractSeg relies on short scan acquisitions and widely accessible software packages, making it attractive for use in healthy populations to explore normal amygdala nucleus function, as well as in clinical and pediatric populations. Finally, it paves the way for implementing this method in other anatomical regions which are also composed of functional subunits that are difficult to distinguish with standard structural MRI. © 2011 Elsevier Inc.},\n",

      "abstract={The cortical underconnectivity theory asserts that reduced long-range functional connectivity might contribute to a neural mechanism for autism. We examined resting-state blood oxygen level-dependent interhemispheric correlation in 53 males with high-functioning autism and 39 typically developing males from late childhood through early adulthood. By constructing spatial maps of correlation between homologous voxels in each hemisphere, we found significantly reduced interhemispheric correlation specific to regions with functional relevance to autism: sensorimotor cortex, anterior insula, fusiform gyrus, superior temporal gyrus, and superior parietal lobule. Observed interhemispheric connectivity differences were better explained by diagnosis of autism than by potentially confounding neuropsychological metrics of language, IQ, or handedness. Although both corpus callosal volume and gray matter interhemispheric connectivity were significantly reduced in autism, no direct relationship was observed between them, suggesting that structural and functional metrics measure different aspects of interhemispheric connectivity. In the control but not the autism sample, there was decreasing interhemispheric correlation with subject age. Greater differences in interhemispheric correlation were seen for more lateral regions in the brain. These findings suggest that long-range connectivity abnormalities in autism are spatially heterogeneous and that transcallosal connectivity is decreased most in regions with functions associated with behavioral abnormalities in autism.

      "abstract={Background Models of autism spectrum disorders (ASD) as neural disconnection syndromes have been predominantly supported by examinations of abnormalities in corticocortical networks in adults with autism. A broader body of research implicates subcortical structures, particularly the striatum, in the physiopathology of autism. Resting state functional magnetic resonance imaging has revealed detailed maps of striatal circuitry in healthy and psychiatric populations and vividly captured maturational changes in striatal circuitry during typical development. Methods Using resting state functional magnetic resonance imaging, we examined striatal functional connectivity (FC) in 20 children with ASD and 20 typically developing children between the ages of 7.6 and 13.5 years. Whole-brain voxelwise statistical maps quantified within-group striatal FC and between-group differences for three caudate and three putamen seeds for each hemisphere. Results Children with ASD mostly exhibited prominent patterns of ectopic striatal FC (i.e., functional connectivity present in ASD but not in typically developing children), with increased functional connectivity between nearly all striatal subregions and heteromodal associative and limbic cortex previously implicated in the physiopathology of ASD (e.g., insular and right superior temporal gyrus). Additionally, we found striatal functional hyperconnectivity with the pons, thus expanding the scope of functional alterations implicated in ASD. Secondary analyses revealed ASD-related hyperconnectivity between the pons and insula cortex. Conclusions Examination of FC of striatal networks in children with ASD revealed abnormalities in circuits involving early developing areas, such as the brainstem and insula, with a pattern of increased FC in ectopic circuits that likely reflects developmental derangement rather than immaturity of functional circuits. © 2011 Society of Biological Psychiatry.},\n",

The present study analyzed the microstructural integrity of the long-range connectivity related to social cognition and language processing with diffusion tractography among adolescents with autism compared with neurotypical adolescents. Tract-specific analyses were used to study the long-range connectivity responsible for integrating social cognition and language processing. Specifically, three pairs of association fibers and three portions of callosal fiber tracts were analyzed. Generalized fractional anisotropy (GFA) values were measured along individual targeted fiber tracts to investigate alterations in microstructure integrity. The asymmetry patterns were also assessed in three pairs of association fibers. In neurotypical participants, we found a consistent leftward asymmetry in three pairs of association fibers. However, adolescents with autism did not demonstrate such asymmetry. Moreover, adolescents with autism had significantly lower mean GFA in three callosal fiber tracts than neurotypical participants. The loss of leftward asymmetry and reduction of interhemispheric connection in adolescents with autism suggest alterations of the long-range connectivity involved in social cognition and language processing.

      "abstract={Recent functional connectivity magnetic resonance imaging and diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) studies have suggested atypical functional connectivity and reduced integrity of long-distance white matter fibers in autism spectrum disorder (ASD). However, evidence for short-distance white matter fibers is still limited, despite some speculation of potential sparing of local connectivity in ASD. Short-distance U-fibers are an important component of neural networks and are thought to play a crucial role in cognitive function. In the present study, we applied tract-based spatial statistics to derive short- and long-distance white matter tracts in frontal, parietal, and temporal lobes in both hemispheres. DTI data were acquired from 26 children with ASD and 24 typically developing (TD) children. A mean fractional anisotropy (FA) image was created and thinned to represent centers of all common tracts. Evidence of compromised short-distance tracts for the ASD group was found in frontal lobe (reduced FA, increased mean diffusivity [MD] and radial diffusivity) as well as in temporal and parietal lobes (increased MD and radial diffusivity). Significant positive correlations between age and FA and negative correlations between age and MD and radial diffusivity were also found for short-distance tracts in each lobe in the TD, but not the ASD group. These results suggest white matter compromise in short-distance tracts in ASD. Absence of typical age-related correlations with DTI indices may reflect altered maturation of short-distance tracts in ASD.

      "abstract={Researchers have recently hypothesized that autism spectrum disorders (ASD) may be partly characterized by physiological over-arousal. One way to assess physiological arousal is through autonomic measures. Here heart period (HP) and parasympathetic activity measured by respiratory sinus arrhythmia (RSA) were examined in adults with ASD and matched controls at rest and during performance of an emotional Stroop task. Resting HP and RSA were lower in adults with ASD than in matched controls, consistent with hypothesized over-arousal in ASD. However, dividing the ASD group on the basis of antipsychotic medication usage revealed that group differences in autonomic arousal may be related to the effects of these medications or their correlates. Autonomic adjustments for Stroop performance were comparable across groups, but in the control group, larger RSA reductions were correlated with faster responding (i.e., better performance). This relation was reversed in the unmedicated ASD group and absent in the medicated ASD group. Findings highlight the importance of considering medication status in the recently burgeoning area of psychophysiological studies of autism. © 2011, International Society for Autism Research, Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},\n",

      "abstract={The neurobiology of autism spectrum disorders (ASDs) has become increasingly understood since the advent of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Initial observations of an above-average head circumference were supported by structural MRI studies that found evidence of increased total brain volume and early rapid brain overgrowth in affected individuals. Subsequent research revealed consistent abnormalities in cortical gray and white matter volume in ASDs. The structural integrity and orientation of white matter have been further elucidated via diffusion tensor imaging methods. The emergence of functional MRI techniques led to an enhanced understanding of the neural circuitry of ASDs, demonstrating areas of dysfunctional cortical activation and atypical cortical specialization. These studies have provided evidence of underconnectivity in distributed cortical networks integral to the core impairments associated with ASDs. Abnormalities in the default-mode network during the resting state have also been identified. Overall, structural and functional MRI research has generated important insights into the neurobiology of ASDs. Additional research is needed to further delineate the underlying brain basis of this constellation of disorders. © 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},\n",

      "abstract={Autism spectrum disorders (ASDs) are typically characterized by impaired social interaction and communication, narrow interests, and repetitive behaviors. The heterogeneity in the severity of these characteristics across individuals with ASD has led some researchers to suggest that these disorders form a continuum which extends into the general, or \"typical,\" population, and there is growing evidence that the extent to which typical adults display autistic traits, as measured using the autism-spectrum quotient (AQ), predicts performance on behavioral tasks that are impaired in ASD. Here, we show that variation in autism spectrum traits is related to cortical structure and function within the typical population. Voxel-based morphometry showed that increased AQ scores were associated with decreased white matter volume in the posterior superior temporal sulcus (pSTS), a region important in processing socially relevant stimuli and associated with structural and functional impairments in ASD. In addition, AQ was correlated with the extent of cortical deactivation of an adjacent area of pSTS during a Stroop task relative to rest, reflecting variation in resting state function. The results provide evidence that autism spectrum characteristics are reflected in neural structure and function across the typical (non-ASD) population. © 2010 The Author.},\n",

      "abstract={Background: Complex neurodevelopmental disorders may be characterized by subtle brain function signatures early in life before behavioral symptoms are apparent. Such endophenotypes may be measurable biomarkers for later cognitive impairments. The nonlinear complexity of electroencephalography (EEG) signals is believed to contain information about the architecture of the neural networks in the brain on many scales. Early detection of abnormalities in EEG signals may be an early biomarker for developmental cognitive disorders. The goal of this paper is to demonstrate that the modified multiscale entropy (mMSE) computed on the basis of resting state EEG data can be used as a biomarker of normal brain development and distinguish typically developing children from a group of infants at high risk for autism spectrum disorder (ASD), defined on the basis of an older sibling with ASD.Methods: Using mMSE as a feature vector, a multiclass support vector machine algorithm was used to classify typically developing and high-risk groups. Classification was computed separately within each age group from 6 to 24 months.Results: Multiscale entropy appears to go through a different developmental trajectory in infants at high risk for autism (HRA) than it does in typically developing controls. Differences appear to be greatest at ages 9 to 12 months. Using several machine learning algorithms with mMSE as a feature vector, infants were classified with over 80% accuracy into control and HRA groups at age 9 months. Classification accuracy for boys was close to 100% at age 9 months and remains high (70% to 90%) at ages 12 and 18 months. For girls, classification accuracy was highest at age 6 months, but declines thereafter.Conclusions: This proof-of-principle study suggests that mMSE computed from resting state EEG signals may be a useful biomarker for early detection of risk for ASD and abnormalities in cognitive development in infants. To our knowledge, this is the first demonstration of an information theoretic analysis of EEG data for biomarkers in infants at risk for a complex neurodevelopmental disorder. © 2011 Bosl et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.},\n",

      "abstract={Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (AD/HD) is the most common psychiatric disorder of childhood, although AD/HD is rarely the only diagnosis given to these children. Within the literature there is some debate as to whether it is valid to diagnose AD/HD with autism as a comorbid disorder, since the present diagnostic systems exclude the diagnosis of both disorders in the same child. The aim of this study was to determine whether electroencephalography (EEG) differences exist between two groups of children diagnosed with AD/HD, one scoring high (AD/HD+) and one scoring low (AD/HD-) on a measure of autism. The EEG was recorded during an eyes-closed resting condition from 19 electrodes, and Fourier transformed to provide absolute and relative power estimates in delta, theta, alpha and beta bands. Compared to age- and sex-matched controls, the AD/HD- group had increased absolute power in all frequency bands, somewhat higher relative theta activity and decreased relative delta. In comparison to the AD/HD- group, patients with autistic features (AD/HD+) had a number of qualitative differences in the beta and theta bands. These results indicate the presence of two comorbid conditions in the AD/HD+ group, which suggests that AD/HD and autism can occur in the same individual. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd.},\n",

      "abstract={Over the last years, increasing evidence has fuelled the hypothesis that Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) is a condition of altered brain functional connectivity. The great majority of these empirical studies relies on functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) which has a relatively poor temporal resolution. Only a handful of studies has examined networks emerging from dynamic coherence at the millisecond resolution and there are no investigations of coherence at the lowest frequencies in the power spectrum-which has recently been shown to reflect long-range cortico-cortical connections. Here we used electroencephalography (EEG) to assess dynamic brain connectivity in ASD focusing in the low-frequency (delta) range. We found that connectivity patterns were distinct in ASD and control populations and reflected a double dissociation: ASD subjects lacked long-range connections, with a most prominent deficit in fronto-occipital connections. Conversely, individuals with ASD showed increased short-range connections in lateral-frontal electrodes. This effect between categories showed a consistent parametric dependency: as ASD severity increased, short-range coherence was more pronounced and long-range coherence decreased. Theoretical arguments have been proposed arguing that distinct patterns of connectivity may result in networks with different efficiency in transmission of information. We show that the networks in ASD subjects have less Clustering coefficient, greater Characteristic Path Length than controls - indicating that the topology of the network departs from small-world behaviour - and greater modularity. Together these results show that delta-band coherence reveal qualitative and quantitative aspects associated with ASD pathology. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.},\n",

      "abstract={Newly emerging theories suggest that the brain does not function as a cohesive unit in autism, and this discordance is reflected in the behavioral symptoms displayed by individuals with autism. While structural neuroimaging findings have provided some insights into brain abnormalities in autism, the consistency of such findings is questionable. Functional neuroimaging, on the other hand, has been more fruitful in this regard because autism is a disorder of dynamic processing and allows examination of communication between cortical networks, which appears to be where the underlying problem occurs in autism. Functional connectivity is defined as the temporal correlation of spatially separate neurological events1. Findings from a number of recent fMRI studies have supported the idea that there is weaker coordination between different parts of the brain that should be working together to accomplish complex social or language problems. One of the mysteries of autism is the coexistence of deficits in several domains along with relatively intact, sometimes enhanced, abilities. Such complex manifestation of autism calls for a global and comprehensive examination of the disorder at the neural level. A compelling recent account of the brain functioning in autism, the cortical underconnectivity theory, provides an integrating framework for the neurobiological bases of autism. The cortical nderconnectivity theory of autism suggests that any language, social, or psychological function that is dependent on the integration of multiple brain regions is susceptible to disruption as the processing demand increases. In autism, the underfunctioning of integrative circuitry in the brain may cause widespread underconnectivity. In other words, people with autism may interpret information in a piecemeal fashion at the expense of the whole. Since cortical underconnectivity among brain regions, especially the frontal cortex and more posterior areas, has now been relatively well established, we can begin to further understand brain connectivity as a critical component of autism symptomatology. A logical next step in this direction is to examine the anatomical connections that may mediate the functional connections mentioned above. Diffusion Tensor Imaging (DTI) is a relatively novel neuroimaging technique that helps probe the diffusion of water in the brain to infer the integrity of white matter fibers. In this technique, water diffusion in the brain is examined in several directions using diffusion gradients. While functional connectivity provides information about the synchronization of brain activation across different brain areas during a task or during rest, DTI helps in understanding the underlying axonal organization which may facilitate the cross-talk among brain areas. This paper will describe these techniques as valuable tools in understanding the brain in autism and the challenges involved in this line of research. © 2011 Journal of Visualized Experiments.},\n",

      "abstract={Personal pronouns, such as 'I' and 'you', require a speaker/listener to continuously re-map their reciprocal relation to their referent, depending on who is saying the pronoun. This process, called 'deictic shifting', may underlie the incorrect production of these pronouns, or 'pronoun reversals', such as referring to oneself with the pronoun 'you', which has been reported in children with autism. The underlying neural basis of deictic shifting, however, is not understood, nor has the processing of pronouns been studied in adults with autism. The present study compared the brain activation pattern and functional connectivity (synchronization of activation across brain areas) of adults with high-functioning autism and control participants using functional magnetic resonance imaging in a linguistic perspective-taking task that required deictic shifting. The results revealed significantly diminished frontal (right anterior insula) to posterior (precuneus) functional connectivity during deictic shifting in the autism group, as well as reliably slower and less accurate behavioural responses. A comparison of two types of deictic shifting revealed that the functional connectivity between the right anterior insula and precuneus was lower in autism while answering a question that contained the pronoun 'you', querying something about the participant's view, but not when answering a query about someone else's view. In addition to the functional connectivity between the right anterior insula and precuneus being lower in autism, activation in each region was atypical, suggesting over reliance on individual regions as a potential compensation for the lower level of collaborative interregional processing. These findings indicate that deictic shifting constitutes a challenge for adults with high-functioning autism, particularly when reference to one's self is involved, and that the functional collaboration of two critical nodes, right anterior insula and precuneus, may play a critical role for deictic shifting by supporting an attention shift between oneself and others. © 2011 The Author.},\n",

Since autism is a developmental disorder, we aim to investigate the nature and location of decreases in white and grey matter integrity in an adolescent sample while accounting for age. Methods: We used structural (T1) imaging to study brain volumetrics and diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) to investigate white and grey matter integrity in people with autism. We obtained magnetic resonance images for adolescents aged 12-18 years with high-functioning autism and from matched controls. Fractional anisotropy and mean diffusivity, as well as grey and white matter volumetrics were analyzed. Results: There were 17 participants with autism and 25 matched controls included in this study. Participants with autism had lower fractional anisotropy in the left and right superior and inferior longitudinal fasciculus, but this effect was not significant after adjusting for age and intelligence quotient (IQ). The kurtosis of the white matter fractional anisotropy probability distribution was higher in this participant group, with and without adjustment for age and IQ. Most notably, however, the mean diffusivity levels were markedly increased in the autism group throughout the brain, and the mean diffusivity probability distributions of both grey and white matter were shifted toward a higher value, particularly with age and IQ adjustment. No volumetric differences in grey and white matter were found. Limitations: We corrected for age and IQ using a linear model. The study was also limited by its sample size, investigated age range and cross-sectional design. Conclusion: The findings suggest that autism is characterized by a generalized reduction of white matter integrity that is associated with an increase of interstitial space.

Fractal parameters such as the Hurst exponent, H, describe the complexity of endogenous low-frequency fMRI time series on a continuum from random (H = .5) to ordered (H = 1). Shifts in fractal scaling of physiological time series have been associated with neurological and cardiac conditions. Methods Resting-state fMRI time series were recorded in 30 male adults with an autism spectrum condition (ASC) and 33 age- and IQ-matched male volunteers. The Hurst exponent was estimated in the wavelet domain and between-group differences were investigated at global and voxel level and in regions known to be involved in autism. Results Complex fractal scaling of fMRI time series was found in both groups but globally there was a significant shift to randomness in the ASC (mean H = .758, SD = .045) compared with neurotypical volunteers (mean H = .788, SD = .047). Between-group differences in H, which was always reduced in the ASC group, were seen in most regions previously reported to be involved in autism, including cortical midline structures, medial temporal structures, lateral temporal and parietal structures, insula, amygdala, basal ganglia, thalamus, and inferior frontal gyrus. Severity of autistic symptoms was negatively correlated with H in retrosplenial and right anterior insular cortex.

      "abstract={Mentalization is the process by which an observer views a target as possessing higher cognitive faculties such as goals, intentions and desires. Mentalization can be assessed using action identification paradigms, in which observers choose mentalistic (goals-focused) or mechanistic (action-focused) descriptions of targets' actions. Neural structures that play key roles in inferring goals and intentions from others' observed or imagined actions include temporo-parietal junction, ventral premotor cortex and extrastriate body area. We hypothesized that these regions play a role in action identification as well. Data collected using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) confirmed our predictions that activity in ventral premotor cortex and middle temporal gyrus near the extrastriate body area varies both as a function of the valence of the target and the extent to which actions are identified as goal-directed. In addition, the inferior parietal lobule is preferentially engaged when participants identify the actions of mentalized targets. Functional connectivity analyses suggest support from other regions, including the medial prefrontal cortex and amygdala, during mentalization. We found correlations between action identification and Autism Quotient scores, suggesting that understanding the neural correlates of action identification may enhance our understanding of the underpinnings of essential social cognitive processes.

      "abstract={Objective Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is increasingly viewed as a disorder of functional networks, highlighting the importance of investigating white matter and interregional connectivity. We used diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) to examine white matter integrity for the whole brain and for corpus callosum, internal capsule, and middle cerebellar peduncle in children with ASD and typically developing (TD) children. Method DTI data were obtained from 26 children with ASD and 24 matched TD children. Fractional anisotropy (FA), mean diffusivity (MD), and axial and radial diffusion were calculated for the whole brain, the genu, body, and splenium of the corpus callosum, the genu and anterior and posterior limbs of the internal capsule, and the middle cerebellar peduncle. Results Children with ASD had reduced FA and increased radial diffusion for whole-brain white matter and all three segments of the corpus callosum and internal capsule, compared with those in TD children. Increased MD was found for the whole brain and for anterior and posterior limbs of the internal capsule. Reduced axial diffusion was found for the body of corpus callosum. Reduced FA was also found for the middle cerebellar peduncle. Conclusions Our findings suggest widespread white matter compromise in children with ASD. Abnormalities in the corpus callosum indicate impaired interhemispheric transfer. Results for the internal capsule and middle cerebellar peduncle add to the currently limited DTI evidence on subcortico-cortical tracts in ASD. The robust impairment found in all three segments of the internal capsule is consistent with studies documenting impairment of elementary sensorimotor function in ASD. © 2010 American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry.},\n",

      "abstract={Genetic studies are rapidly identifying variants that shape risk for disorders of human cognition, but the question of how such variants predispose to neuropsychiatric disease remains. Noninvasive human brain imaging allows assessment of the brain in vivo, and the combination of genetics and imaging phenotypes remains one of the only ways to explore functional genotype-phenotype associations in human brain. Common variants in contactin-associated protein-like 2 (CNTNAP2), a neurexin superfamily member, have been associated with several allied neurodevelopmental disorders, including autism and specific language impairment, and CNTNAP2 is highly expressed in frontal lobe circuits in the developing human brain. Using functional neuroimaging, we have demonstrated a relationship between frontal lobar connectivity and common genetic variants in CNTNAP2. These data provide a mechanistic link between specific genetic risk for neurodevelopmental disorders and empirical data implicating dysfunction of long-range connections within the frontal lobe in autism. The convergence between genetic findings and cognitive-behavioral models of autism provides evidence that genetic variation at CNTNAP2 predisposes to diseases such as autism in part through modulation of frontal lobe connectivity.},\n",

      "abstract={Individuals with high-functioning autism sometimes exhibit intact or superior performance on visuospatial tasks, in contrast to impaired functioning in other domains such as language comprehension, executive tasks, and social functions. The goal of the current study was to investigate the neural bases of preserved visuospatial processing in high-functioning autism from the perspective of the cortical underconnectivity theory. We used a combination of behavioral, functional magnetic resonance imaging, functional connectivity, and corpus callosum morphometric methodological tools. Thirteen participants with high-functioning autism and 13 controls (age-, IQ-, and gender-matched) were scanned while performing an Embedded Figures Task. Despite the ability of the autism group to attain behavioral performance comparable to the control group, the brain imaging results revealed several group differences consistent with the cortical underconnectivity account of autism. First, relative to controls, the autism group showed less activation in the left dorsolateral prefrontal and inferior parietal areas and more activation in visuospatial (bilateral superior parietal extending to inferior parietal and right occipital) areas. Second, the autism group demonstrated lower functional connectivity between higher-order working memory/executive areas and visuospatial regions (between frontal and parietal-occipital). Third, the size of the corpus callosum (an index of anatomical connectivity) was positively correlated with frontal-posterior (parietal and occipital) functional connectivity in the autism group. Thus, even in the visuospatial domain, where preserved performance among people with autism is observed, the neuroimaging signatures of cortical underconnectivity persist. © 2010, International Society for Autism Research, Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},\n",

      "abstract={Imitation has been considered as one of the precursors for sociocommunicative development. Impairments of imitation in autism spectrum disorder (ASD) could be indicative of dysfunctional underlying neural processes. Neuroimaging studies have found reduced activation in areas associated with imitation, but a functional connectivity MRI network perspective of these regions in autism is unavailable. Functional and effective connectivity was examined in 14 male participants with ASD and 14 matched typically developing (TD) participants. We analyzed intrinsic, low-frequency blood oxygen level dependent (BOLD) fluctuations of three regions in literature found to be associated with imitation (inferior frontal gyrus [IFG], inferior parietal lobule [IPL], superior temporal sulcus [STS]). Direct group comparisons did not show significantly reduced functional connectivity within the imitation network in ASD. Conversely, we observed greater connectivity with frontal regions, particularly superior frontal and anterior cingulate gyri, in the ASD compared to TD group. Structural equation modeling of effective connectivity revealed a significantly reduced effect of IPL on IFG together with an increased influence of a region in dorsal prefrontal cortex (dPFC) on IFG in the ASD group. Our results suggest atypical connectivity of the imitation network with an enhanced role of dPFC, which may relate to behavioral impairments. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.},\n",

      "abstract={Response inhibition, or the suppression of prepotent, but contextually inappropriate behaviors, is essential to adaptive, flexible responding. In autism spectrum disorders (ASD), difficulty inhibiting prepotent behaviors may contribute to restricted, repetitive behavior (RRB). Individuals with ASD consistently show deficient response inhibition while performing antisaccades, which require one to inhibit the prepotent response of looking towards a suddenly appearing stimulus (i.e., a prosaccade), and to substitute a gaze in the opposite direction. Here, we used fMRI to identify the neural correlates of this deficit. We focused on two regions that are critical for saccadic inhibition: the frontal eye field (FEF), the key cortical region for generating volitional saccades, and the dorsal anterior cingulate cortex (dACC), which is thought to exert top-down control on the FEF. We also compared ASD and control groups on the functional connectivity of the dACC and FEF during saccadic performance. In the context of an increased antisaccade error rate, ASD participants showed decreased functional connectivity of the FEF and dACC and decreased inhibition-related activation (based on the contrast of antisaccades and prosaccades) in both regions. Decreased dACC activation correlated with a higher error rate in both groups, consistent with a role in top-down control. Within the ASD group, increased FEF activation and dACC/FEF functional connectivity were associated with more severe RRB. These findings demonstrate functional abnormalities in a circuit critical for volitional ocular motor control in ASD that may contribute to deficient response inhibition and to RRB. More generally, our findings suggest reduced cognitive control over behavior by the dACC in ASD. © 2010 Elsevier Inc.},\n",

      "abstract={A deficit in global motion processing caused by a specific dysfunction of the visual dorsal pathway has been suggested to underlie perceptual abnormalities in subjects with autism spectrum disorders (ASD). However, the neural mechanisms associated with abnormal motion processing in ASD remain poorly understood. We investigated brain responses related to the detection of coherent and random motion in 15 male subjects with ASD and 15 age- and IQ-matched healthy controls (aged 13-19 years) using event-related functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). Behaviorally, no significant group differences were observed between subjects with ASD and controls. Neurally, subjects with ASD showed increased brain activation in the left primary visual cortex across all conditions compared with controls. A significant interaction effect between group and condition was observed in the right superior parietal cortex resulting from increased neural activity in the coherent compared with the random motion conditions only in the control group. In addition, neural activity in area V5 was not differentially modulated by specific motion conditions in subjects with ASD. Functional connectivity analyses revealed positive correlations between the primary visual cortex and area V5 within both hemispheres, but no significant between-group differences in functional connectivity patterns along the dorsal stream. The data suggest that motion processing in ASD results in deviant activations in both the lower and higher processing stages of the dorsal pathway. This might reflect differences in the perception of visual stimuli in ASD, which possibly result in impaired integration of motion signals. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.},\n",

Analysis of regional homogeneity (ReHo) measures the local synchronization of spontaneous fMRI signals and has been successfully utilized in detecting alterations in subjects with attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), depression, schizophrenia, Parkinson's disease and Alzheimer's dementia. Resting-state brain activity was investigated in 28 adolescents with autism spectrum disorders (ASD) and 27 typically developing controls being imaged with BOLD fMRI and analyzed with the ReHo method. The hypothesis was that ReHo of resting-state brain activity would be different between ASD subjects and controls in brain areas previously shown to display functional alterations in stimulus or task based fMRI studies. Compared with the controls, the subjects with ASD had significantly decreased ReHo in right superior temporal sulcus region, right inferior and middle frontal gyri, bilateral cerebellar crus I, right insula and right postcentral gyrus. Significantly increased ReHo was discovered in right thalamus, left inferior frontal and anterior subcallosal gyrus and bilateral cerebellar lobule VIII. We conclude that subjects with ASD have right dominant ReHo alterations of resting-state brain activity, i.e., areas known to exhibit abnormal stimulus or task related functionality. Our results demonstrate that there is potential in utilizing the ReHo method in fMRI analyses of ASD. © 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},\n",

The between group comparison of the contrast [observation versus rest] provided evidence of a bilateral greater activation of inferior frontal gyrus during observation of human motion than during rest for the ASD group than for the TD group. This hyperactivation of the pars opercularis (belonging to the MNS) during observation of human motion in autistic subjects provides strong support for the hypothesis of atypical activity of the MNS that may be at the core of the social deficits in autism. © 2010 Elsevier B.V.

      "abstract={Background: In addition to their more clinically evident abnormalities of social cognition, people with autism spectrum conditions (ASC) manifest perturbations of attention and sensory perception which may offer insights into the underlying neural abnormalities. Similar autistic traits in ASC relatives without a diagnosis suggest a continuity between clinically affected and unaffected family members. Methods: We applied fMRI in the context of a non-social task of visual attention in order to determine whether this continuity persists at the level of brain physiology. Results: Both boys with ASC and clinically unaffected brothers of people with ASC were impaired at a visual divided-attention task demanding conjunction of attributes from rapidly and simultaneously presented, spatially disjoint stimuli and suppression of spatially intervening distractors. In addition, both groups in comparison to controls manifested atypical fronto-cerebellar activation as a function of distractor congruence, and the degree of this frontal atypicality correlated with psychometric measures of autistic traits in ASC and sibs. Despite these resemblances between the ASC and sib groups, an exploratory, hypothesis-generating analysis of correlations across brain regions revealed a decrease in overall functional correlation only in the ASC group and not in the sibs. Conclusions: These results establish a neurophysiological correlate of familial susceptibility to ASC, and suggest that whilst abnormal time courses of frontal activation may reflect processes permissive of autistic brain development, abnormal patterns of functional correlation across a wider array of brain regions may relate more closely to autism's determinants. © 2009 Association for Child and Adolescent Mental Health.},\n",

      "abstract={Autism spectrum disorders (ASD) are associated with disturbances of neural connectivity. Functional connectivity between neural structures is typically examined within the context of a cognitive task, but also exists in the absence of a task (i.e., \"rest\"). Connectivity during rest is particularly active in a set of structures called the default network, which includes the posterior cingulate cortex (PCC), retrosplenial cortex, lateral parietal cortex/angular gyrus, medial prefrontal cortex, superior frontal gyrus, temporal lobe, and parahippocampal gyrus. We previously reported that adults with ASD relative to controls show areas of stronger and weaker connectivity within the default network. The objective of the present study was to examine the default network in adolescents with ASD. Sixteen adolescents with ASD and 15 controls participated in a functional MRI study. Functional connectivity was examined between a PCC seed and other areas of the default network. Both groups showed connectivity in the default network. Relative to controls, adolescents with ASD showed widespread weaker connectivity in nine of the eleven areas of the default network. Moreover, an analysis of symptom severity indicated that poorer social skills and increases in restricted and repetitive behaviors and interests correlated with weaker connectivity, whereas poorer verbal and non-verbal communication correlated with stronger connectivity in multiple areas of the default network. These findings indicate that adolescents with ASD show weaker connectivity in the default network than previously reported in adults with ASD. The findings also show that weaker connectivity within the default network is associated with specific impairments in ASD. © 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},\n",

Methods: Fourteen autistic boys, aged 6-14 years, free of drug treatment, with I.Q. 91.4 ± 22.8, and 19 normally developing boys were subject to stimulation of 12 fixed frequencies of 3-27 Hz. The number of high coherent connections (HCC) (coherence >0.6-0.8) was estimated among 7 leads in each hemisphere. Results: In contrast to the spectral characteristics showing the right hemisphere deficit in the photic driving reactivity, the number of HCC differentiated the groups only in the left hemisphere where it was higher in autistics at the EEG frequencies corresponding to those of stimulation at 6-27 Hz without asymmetry at other frequencies, the left-side prevalence increasing with frequency. No asymmetry was observed in the resting state. Conclusions: Spectral and coherence characteristics of the EEG photic driving show different aspects of latent abnormal interhemispheric asymmetry in autistics: the right hemisphere \"hyporeactivity\" and potential \"hyperconectivity\" of likely compensatory nature in the left hemisphere.

In studies of autism spectrum disorder (ASD), decreases in this measure of connectivity have been found by focusing on the response to task modulation, by using only the rest periods, or by analyzing purely resting-state data. This difference in connectivity, however, could result from a number of different mechanisms - differences in noise, task-related fluctuations, task performance, or spontaneous neuronal activity. In this study, we investigate the difference in functional connectivity between adolescents with high-functioning ASD and typically developing control subjects by examining the residual fluctuations occurring on top of the fMRI response to an overt verbal fluency task. We find decreased correlations of these residuals (a decreased \"connectivity\") in ASD subjects. Furthermore, we find that this decrease was not due to task-related effects, block-to-block variations in task performance, or increased noise, and the difference was greatest when primarily rest periods are considered. These findings suggest that the estimate of disrupted functional connectivity in ASD is likely driven by differences in task-unrelated neuronal fluctuations.},\n",

As such, noninvasive modulation of this network may represent a potential therapeutic intervention for a number of neurological and psychiatric pathologies linked to abnormal network activation. One possible tool to effect this modulation is Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation: a non-invasive neurostimulatory and neuromodulatory technique that can transiently or lastingly modulate cortical excitability (either increasing or decreasing it) via the application of localized magnetic field pulses.9 In order to explore the default mode network's propensity towards and tolerance of modulation, we will be combining TMS (to the left inferior parietal lobe) with functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). Through this article, we will examine the protocol and considerations necessary to successfully combine these two neuroscientific tools.},\n",

      "abstract={High-functioning individuals with autism have been found to favor visuospatial processing in the face of typically poor language abilities. We aimed to examine the neurobiological basis of this difference using functional magnetic resonance imaging and diffusion tensor imaging. We compared 12 children with high functioning autism (HFA) to 12 age- and IQ-matched typically developing controls (CTRL) on a pictorial reasoning paradigm under three conditions: V, requiring visuospatial processing; S, requiring language (i.e., semantic) processing; and V+S, a hybrid condition in which language use could facilitate visuospatial transformations. Activated areas in the brain were chosen as endpoints for probabilistic diffusion tractography to examine tract integrity (FA) within the structural network underlying the activation patterns. The two groups showed similar networks, with linguistic processing activating inferior frontal, superior and middle temporal, ventral visual, and temporo-parietal areas, whereas visuospatial processing activated occipital and inferior parietal cortices. However, HFA appeared to activate occipito-parietal and ventral temporal areas, whereas CTRL relied more on frontal and temporal language regions. The increased reliance on visuospatial abilities in HFA was supported by intact connections between the inferior parietal and the ventral temporal ROIs. In contrast, the inferior frontal region showed reduced connectivity to ventral temporal and middle temporal areas in this group, reflecting impaired activation of frontal language areas in autism. The HFA group's engagement of posterior brain regions along with its weak connections to frontal language areas suggest support for a reliance on visual mediation in autism, even in tasks of higher cognition. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

      "abstract={The 'self' is a complex multidimensional construct deeply embedded and in many ways defined by our relations with the social world. Individuals with autism are impaired in both self-referential and other-referential social cognitive processing. Atypical neural representation of the self may be a key to understanding the nature of such impairments. Using functional magnetic resonance imaging we scanned adult males with an autism spectrum condition and age and IQ-matched neurotypical males while they made reflective mentalizing or physical judgements about themselves or the British Queen. Neurotypical individuals preferentially recruit the middle cingulate cortex and ventromedial prefrontal cortex in response to self compared with other-referential processing. In autism, ventromedial prefrontal cortex responded equally to self and other, while middle cingulate cortex responded more to other-mentalizing than self-mentalizing. These atypical responses occur only in areas where self-information is preferentially processed and does not affect areas that preferentially respond to other-referential information. In autism, atypical neural self-representation was also apparent via reduced functional connectivity between ventromedial prefrontal cortex and areas associated with lower level embodied representations, such as ventral premotor and somatosensory cortex. Furthermore, the magnitude of neural self-other distinction in ventromedial prefrontal cortex was strongly related to the magnitude of early childhood social impairments in autism. Individuals whose ventromedial prefrontal cortex made the largest distinction between mentalizing about self and other were least socially impaired in early childhood, while those whose ventromedial prefrontal cortex made little to no distinction between mentalizing about self and other were the most socially impaired in early childhood. These observations reveal that the atypical organization of neural circuitry preferentially coding for self-information is a key mechanism at the heart of both self-referential and social impairments in autism.},\n",

      "abstract={Background: Autism spectrum disorders (ASD) are associated with severe impairments in social functioning. Because faces provide nonverbal cues that support social interactions, many studies of ASD have examined neural structures that process faces, including the amygdala, ventromedial prefrontal cortex and superior and middle temporal gyri. However, increases or decreases in activation are often contingent on the cognitive task. Specifically, the cognitive domain of attention influences group differences in brain activation. We investigated brain function abnormalities in participants with ASD using a task that monitored attention bias to emotional faces. Methods: Twenty-four participants (12 with ASD, 12 controls) completed a functional magnetic resonance imaging study while performing an attention cuing task with emotional (happy, sad, angry) and neutral faces. Results: In response to emotional faces, those in the ASD group showed greater right amygdala activation than those in the control group. A preliminary psychophysiological connectivity analysis showed that ASD participants had stronger positive right amygdala and ventromedial prefrontal cortex coupling and weaker positive right amygdala and temporal lobe coupling than controls. There were no group differences in the behavioural measure of attention bias to the emotional faces. Limitations: The small sample size may have affected our ability to detect additional group differences. Conclusion: When attention bias to emotional faces was equivalent between ASD and control groups, ASD was associated with greater amygdala activation. Preliminary analyses showed that ASD participants had stronger connectivity between the amygdala ventromedial prefrontal cortex (a network implicated in emotional modulation) and weaker connectivity between the amygdala and temporal lobe (a pathway involved in the identification of facial expressions, although areas of group differences were generally in a more anterior region of the temporal lobe than what is typically reported for emotional face processing). These alterations in connectivity are consistent with emotion and face processing disturbances in ASD. © 2010 Canadian Medical Association.},\n",

      "abstract={People on the autism spectrum often experience states of emotional or cognitive overload that pose challenges to their interests in learning and communicating. Measurements taken from home and school environments show that extreme overload experienced internally, measured as autonomic nervous system (ANS) activation, may not be visible externally: a person can have a resting heart rate twice the level of non-autistic peers, while outwardly appearing calm and relaxed. The chasm between what is happening on the inside and what is seen on the outside, coupled with challenges in speaking and being pushed to perform, is a recipe for a meltdown that may seem to come 'out of the blue', but in fact may have been steadily building. Because ANS activation both influences and is influenced by efforts to process sensory information, interact socially, initiate motor activity, produce meaningful speech and more, deciphering the dynamics of ANS states is important for understanding and helping people on the autism spectrum. This paper highlights advances in technology that can comfortably sense and communicate ANS arousal in daily life, allowing new kinds of investigations to inform the science of autism while also providing personalized feedback to help individuals who participate in the research. © 2009 The Royal Society.},\n",

      "abstract={Executive function deficits are among the most frequently reported symptoms of autism spectrum disorders (ASDs), however, there have been few functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) studies that investigate the neural substrates of executive function deficits in ASDs, and only one in adolescents. The current study examined cognitive control - the ability to maintain task context online to support adaptive functioning in the face of response competition - in 22 adolescents aged 12-18 with autism spectrum disorders and 23 age, gender, and IQ matched typically developing subjects. During the cue phase of the task, where subjects must maintain information online to overcome a prepotent response tendency, typically developing subjects recruited significantly more anterior frontal (BA 10), parietal (BA 7 and BA 40), and occipital regions (BA 18) for high control trials (25% of trials) versus low control trials (75% of trials). Both groups showed similar activation for low control cues, however the ASD group exhibited significantly less activation for high control cues. Functional connectivity analysis using time series correlation, factor analysis, and beta series correlation methods provided convergent evidence that the ASD group exhibited lower levels of functional connectivity and less network integration between frontal, parietal, and occipital regions. In the typically developing group, fronto-parietal connectivity was related to lower error rates on high control trials. In the autism group, reduced fronto-parietal connectivity was related to attention deficit hyperactivity disorder symptoms. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},\n",

Based on increased recognition of the dimensional nature of autistic traits, the authors examined the neural correlates of these traits in neurotypical individuals using the SRSA and established a novel approach to assessing the neural basis of autistic characteristics, attempting to directly relate SRSA scores to patterns of functional connectivity observed in the pregenual anterior cingulate cortex, a region commonly implicated in social cognition. Methods: Resting state functional magnetic resonance imaging scans were collected for 25 neurotypical adults. All participants provided SRS-A ratings completed by an informant who had observed them in natural social settings. Whole brain-corrected connectivity analyses were then conducted using SRS-A scores as a covariate of interest. Results: Across participants, a significant negative relationship between SRS-A scores and the functional connectivity of the pregenual anterior cingulate cortex with the anterior portion of the mid-insula was found. Specifically, low levels of autistic traits were observed when a substantial portion of the anterior mid-insula showed positive connectivity with the pregenual anterior cingulate cortex. In contrast, elevated levels of autistic traits were associated with negative connectivity between these two regions. Conclusions: Resting state functional connectivity of the pregenual anterior cingulate cortex-insula social network was related to autistic traits in neurotypical adults. Application of this approach in samples with autism spectrum disorders is needed to confirm whether this circuit is dimensionally related to the severity of autistic traits in clinical populations.},\n",

      "abstract={Autism spectrum disorders (ASD) impact social functioning and communication, and individuals with these disorders often have restrictive and repetitive behaviors. Accumulating data indicate that ASD is associated with alterations of neural circuitry. Functional MRI (FMRI) studies have focused on connectivity in the context of psychological tasks. However, even in the absence of a task, the brain exhibits a high degree of functional connectivity, known as intrinsic or resting connectivity. Notably, the default network, which includes the posterior cingulate cortex, retro-splenial, lateral parietal cortex/angular gyrus, medial prefrontal cortex, superior frontal gyrus, temporal lobe, and parahippocampal gyrus, is strongly active when there is no task. Altered intrinsic connectivity within the default network may underlie offline processing that may actuate ASD impairments. Using FMRI, we sought to evaluate intrinsic connectivity within the default network in ASD. Relative to controls, the ASD group showed weaker connectivity between the posterior cingulate cortex and superior frontal gyrus and stronger connectivity between the posterior cingulate cortex and both the right temporal lobe and right parahippocampal gyrus. Moreover, poorer social functioning in the ASD group was correlated with weaker connectivity between the posterior cingulate cortex and the superior frontal gyrus. In addition, more severe restricted and repetitive behaviors in ASD were correlated with stronger connectivity between the posterior cingulate cortex and right parahippocampal gyrus. These findings indicate that ASD subjects show altered intrinsic connectivity within the default network, and connectivity between these structures is associated with specific ASD symptoms. © 2009 Elsevier Inc.

      "abstract={The Default Mode Network (DMN) is a constellation of brain areas that decrease their activity during a wide number of different goal-oriented tasks as compared to passive \"rest\" tasks. DMN can be modulated by different factors such as emotional states, cognitive load of the task and psychopathology, including anxiety. Moreover, DMN seems to play a pivotal role in social cognition. For example, the ability to predict another person's behaviour taking his or her perspective modulates the activity of the DMN. Recent data from autistic patients support a role of DMN in social cognition as well. Social Phobia (SP) is an anxiety disorder characterized by an abnormal distress in situations that require social interaction. To date, no study has assessed DMN in Social Phobia. To determine potential differences in DMN activity between Social Phobia patients (SPP) and healthy control (HC) subjects we examined functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data obtained during a face perception study with emotional and neutral stimuli. As compared to HC, SPP showed a lower deactivation in the precuneus and posterior cingulate regions (PCun/PCC) during task conditions. These regions are part of the so-called \"Theory of Mind\" circuit and in particular they are involved in the evaluation of one's own emotional state. Because of the role of the PCun/PCC in self-state perception and attribution and, more in general, the role of the DMN in social cognition, we suggest that its impairment in the DMN network in SPP might be relevant in the development of the feeling of wariness of others' judgment and may be related to the so-called self-focused attention. Self-focused attention is the awareness of self-referent information, and is present in many emotional disorders and may additionally prevent individuals from observing external information that could disconfirm their own fears. Moreover, the abnormal modulation of activity in the DMN may reflect persistent rumination or anxiety-related thoughts that are not modulated by the switch from rest to task. © 2009 Elsevier Inc.

A functional connectivity magnetic resonance imaging (fcMRI) analysis was performed on data collected during Go/NoGo task performance from 24 children ages 8-12 years (12 with ASD; 12 controls matched on age and intellectual functioning). We investigated the connectivity of the left and right inferior frontal cortex (IFC; BA 47), key regions for response inhibition, with other active regions in frontal, striatal, and parietal cortex. Groups did not differ on behavioral measures or functional connectivity of either IFC region. A trend for reduced connectivity in the right IFC for the ASD group was revealed when controlling for age. In the ASD group, there was a significant negative correlation between age and 2 right IFC correlation pairs: right IFC-bilateral presupplementary motor area (BA 6) and right IFC-right caudate. Compared with typical controls, children with ASD may not have gross differences in IFC functional connectivity during response inhibition, which contrasts with an adult study of ASD that reported reduced functional connectivity. This discrepancy suggests an atypical developmental trajectory in ASD for right IFC connectivity with other neural regions supporting response inhibition.},\n",

Here we use network analysis of intrinsic functional connectivity to characterize the organization of brain networks in 23 children (ages 7-9 y) and 22 young-adults (ages 19-22 y). Comparison of network properties, including path-length, clustering-coefficient, hierarchy, and regional connectivity, revealed that although children and young-adults' brains have similar \"small-world\" organization at the global level, they differ significantly in hierarchical organization and interregional connectivity. We found that subcortical areas were more strongly connected with primary sensory, association, and paralimbic areas in children, whereas young-adults showed stronger cortico-cortical connectivity between paralimbic, limbic, and association areas. Further, combined analysis of functional connectivity with wiring distance measures derived from white-matter fiber tracking revealed that the development of large-scale brain networks is characterized by weakening of short-range functional connectivity and strengthening of long-range functional connectivity. Importantly, our findings show that the dynamic process of over-connectivity followed by pruning, which rewires connectivity at the neuronal level, also operates at the systems level, helping to reconfigure and rebalance subcortical and paralimbic connectivity in the developing brain. Our study demonstrates the usefulness of network analysis of brain connectivity to elucidate key principles underlying functional brain maturation, paving the way for novel studies of disrupted brain connectivity in neurodevelopmental disorders such as autism. © 2009 Supekar et al.},\n",

Autistic patients manifested a significant reduction in the aperture for afferent/efferent cortical connections, i.e., gyral window. Furthermore, the size of the gyral window directly correlated to the size of the corpus callosum. A reduced gyral window constrains the possible size of projection fibers and biases connectivity towards shorter corticocortical fibers at the expense of longer association/commisural fibers.

      "abstract={A number of recent studies have examined functional connectivity in individuals with Autism Spectrum Disorders (ASD), generally converging on the finding of reduced interregional coordination, or underconnectivity. Underconnectivity has been reported between many brain regions and across a range of cognitive tasks, and has been proposed to underlie behavioral and cognitive impairments associated with ASD. The current study employed functional connectivity MRI (fcMRI) to examine interregional correlations of low-frequency BOLD signal fluctuations in 10 high-functioning participants with ASD and 10 typically developing control participants. Whole-brain connectivity with three seed regions of interest (left middle frontal, left superior parietal, and left middle occipital cortex) was evaluated using fMRI datasets acquired during performance of a source recognition task. While fcMRI patterns were found to be largely similar across the two groups, including many common areas, effects for the ASD group were generally more extensive. These findings, although inconsistent with generalized underconnectivity in ASD, are compatible with a model of aberrant connectivity in which the nature of connectivity disturbance (i.e., increased or reduced) may vary by region. Taking into consideration methodological factors that might influence measured fcMRI effects, we suggest that ASD is associated with an inefficiency in optimizing network connections to achieve task performance. © 2008 Elsevier B.V.

      "abstract={Narrative comprehension rests on the ability to understand the intentions and perceptions of various agents in a story who interact with respect to some goal or problem. Reasoning about the state of mind of another person, real or fictional, has been referred to as Theory of Mind processing. While Theory of Mind processing was first postulated prior to the existence of neuroimaging research, fMRI studies make it possible to characterize this processing in some detail. We propose that narrative comprehension makes use of some of the neural substrate of Theory of Mind reasoning, evoking what is referred to as a protagonist perspective network. The main cortical components of this protagonist-based network are the dorsomedial prefrontal cortex and the right temporo-parietal junction. The article discusses how these two cortical centers interact in narrative comprehension but still play distinguishable roles, and how the interaction between the two centers is disrupted in individuals with autism. © 2009 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.},\n",

      "abstract={Although motor deficits are common in autism, the neural correlates underlying the disruption of even basic motor execution are unknown. Motor deficits may be some of the earliest identifiable signs of abnormal development and increased understanding of their neural underpinnings may provide insight into autism-associated differences in parallel systems critical for control of more complex behaviour necessary for social and communicative development. Functional magnetic resonance imaging was used to examine neural activation and connectivity during sequential, appositional finger tapping in 13 children, ages 812 years, with high-functioning autism (HFA) and 13 typically developing (TD), age-and sex-matched peers. Both groups showed expected primary activations in cortical and subcortical regions associated with motor execution [contralateral primary sensorimotor cortex, contralateral thalamus, ipsilateral cerebellum, supplementary motor area (SMA)]; however, the TD group showed greater activation in the ipsilateral anterior cerebellum, while the HFA group showed greater activation in the SMA. Although activation differences were limited to a subset of regions, children with HFA demonstrated diffusely decreased connectivity across the motor execution network relative to control children. The between-group dissociation of cerebral and cerebellar motor activation represents the first neuroimaging data of motor dysfunction in children with autism, providing insight into potentially abnormal circuits impacting development. Decreased cerebellar activation in the HFA group may reflect difficulty shifting motor execution from cortical regions associated with effortful control to regions associated with habitual execution. Additionally, diffusely decreased connectivity may reflect poor coordination within the circuit necessary for automating patterned motor behaviour. The findings might explain impairments in motor development in autism, as well as abnormal and delayed acquisition of gestures important for socialization and communication.},\n",

      "abstract={Immune related abnormalities have repeatedly been reported in autism spectrum disorders (ASD), including evidence of immune dysregulation and autoimmune phenomena. NK cells may play an important role in neurodevelopmental disorders such as ASD. Here we performed a gene expression screen and cellular functional analysis on peripheral blood obtained from 52 children with ASD and 27 typically developing control children enrolled in the case-control CHARGE study. RNA expression of NK cell receptors and effector molecules were significantly upregulated in ASD. Flow cytometric analysis of NK cells demonstrated increased production of perforin, granzyme B, and interferon gamma (IFNγ) under resting conditions in children with ASD (p < 0.01). Following NK cell stimulation in the presence of K562 target cells, the cytotoxicity of NK cells was significantly reduced in ASD compared with controls (p < 0.02). Furthermore, under similar stimulation conditions the presence of perforin, granzyme B, and IFNγ in NK cells from ASD children was significantly lower compared with controls (p < 0.001). These findings suggest possible dysfunction of NK cells in children with ASD. Abnormalities in NK cells may represent a susceptibility factor in ASD and may predispose to the development of autoimmunity and/or adverse neuroimmune interactions during critical periods of development. © 2008 Elsevier Inc.

      "abstract={Autism is associated with widespread atypicalities in perception, cognition and social behavior. A crucial questionconcerns how these atypicalities are reflected in the underlying brain activation. One way to examine possibleperturbations of cortical organization in autism is to analyze the activation of category-selective ventral visual cortex,already clearly delineated in typical populations. We mapped out the neural correlates of face, place and common objectprocessing, using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), in a group of high-functioning adults with autism anda typical comparison group, under both controlled and more naturalistic, viewing conditions. There were no consistentgroup differences in place-related regions. Although there were no significant differences in the extent of the objectrelatedregions, there was more variability for these regions in the autism group. The most marked group differences werein face-selective cortex, with individuals with autism evincing reduced activation, not only in fusiform face area but alsoin superior temporal sulcus and occipital face area. Ventral visual cortex appears to be organized differently in highfunctioningadults with autism, at least for face-selective regions, although subtle differences may also exist for othercategories. We propose that cascading developmental effects of low-level differences in neuronal connectivity result in amuch more pronounced effect on later developing cortical systems, such as that for face-processing, than earliermaturing systems (those for objects and places). © 2008 International Society for Autism Research, Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},\n",

      "abstract={Background. Autism is a disorder characterized by deficits in communication, social interaction, a limited range of interests, and repetitive stereotypical behavior. Although it is believed that changes in the brain leading to Autism occur early on in prenatal and early postnatal development, there is no definitive test for a diagnosis of Autism. The diagnosis is made on the basis of behavioral signs and symptoms alone and is usually not made until age 2 or later. There have been numerous neuroanatomical abnormalities noted in Autism, some of which can be linked to neuropsychological dysfunction. Recently a new theory has become prominent which suggests the disorder may be due to aberrant neural connectivity patterns. Evidence in support of this theory has come from anatomical studies of white matter as well as functional neuroimaging studies. Methods. Most studies have employed functional magnetic resonance imaging to investigate connectivity, or electroencephalography (EEG) coherence studies. The high temporal resolution of EEG lends itself well to the investigation of cerebral connectivity. Research suggests there may be patterns of both hyper- and hypoconnectivity between various brain regions. Seven different patterns of abnormal connectivity which can be analyzed with EEG are proposed. Results. Patterns of hyperconnectivity may be found in frontotemporal and left hemispheric regions, whereas patterns of hypoconnectivity are often seen in frontal (orbitofrontal), right posterior (occipital=parietal-temporal), frontal-posterior, and left hemispheric regions. In addition to these patterns of hypo- and hyperconnectivity, a mu rhythm complex has been identified. Treatment goals may be based on coherence anomalies identified by quantitative EEG analysis. Increased coherence between brain regions may be downtrained, whereas decreased coherence between brain regions may be uptrained. Clinical examples of each pattern and a discussion of their neurofeedback treatment are provided. Conclusion. A theory of autistic disorders is presented that has at its' core neural connectivity disturbances. Multivariate EEG connectivity indices are utilized to formulate a typology of connectivity anomalies or patterns that have been observed over a series of autistic patients. These represent phenotypic expressions of the underlying pathology that leads to autistic symptoms. Examples demonstrate how these connectivity metrics can be used to understand autistic disturbances and formulate neurofeedback strategies for remedying these difficulties. © 2008 by The Haworth Press.},\n",

This research program was initiated with the intention of further specifying the role of the posterior superior temporal sulcus (STS) region in the network of neuroanatomical structures comprising the social brain. Initially, this work focused on evaluating STS function when typically developing adults were engaged in the visual analysis of other people's actions and intentions. We concluded that that the STS region plays an important role in social perception via its involvement in representing and predicting the actions and social intentions of other people from an analysis of biological - motion cues. These studies of typically developing people provided a set of core findings and a methodological approach that informed a set of fMRI studies of social perception dysfunction in autism. The work has established that dysfunction in the STS region, as well as reduced connectivity between this region and other social brain structures including the fusiform gyrus and amygdala, play a role in the pathophysiology of social perception deficits in autism. Most recently, this research program has incorporated a developmental perspective in beginning to chart the development of the STS region in children with and without autism. © 2008 Cambridge University Press.},\n",

      "abstract={Functional magnetic resonance imaging techniques using the blood oxygenation level-dependent (BOLD) contrast are widely used to map human brain function by relating local hemodynamic responses to neuronal stimuli compared to control conditions. There is increasing interest in spontaneous cerebral BOLD fluctuations that are prominent in the low-frequency range (<0.1 Hz) and show intriguing spatio-temporal correlations in functional networks. The nature of these signal fluctuations remains unclear, but there is accumulating evidence for a neural basis opening exciting new avenues to study human brain function and its connectivity at rest. Moreover, an increasing number of patient studies report disease-dependent variation in the amplitude and spatial coherence of low-frequency BOLD fluctuations (LFBF) that may afford greater diagnostic sensitivity and easier clinical applicability than standard fMRI. The main disadvantage of this emerging tool relates to physiological (respiratory, cardiac and vasomotion) and motion confounds that are challenging to disentangle requiring thorough preprocessing. Technical aspects of functional connectivity fMRI analysis and the neuroscientific potential of spontaneous LFBF in the default mode and other resting-state networks have been recently reviewed. This review will give an update on the current knowledge of the nature of LFBF, their relation to physiological confounds and potential for clinical diagnostic and pharmacological studies. © 2008 Elsevier Inc.

Since the default network is also typically engaged during social, emotional and introspective processing, dysfunction of this network may underlie some of the difficulties individuals with autism exhibit in these broad domains. In the present experiment, we attempted to further delineate the nature of default network abnormality in autism using experimentally constrained social and introspective tasks. Thirteen autism and 12 control participants were scanned while making true/false judgments for various statements about themselves (SELF condition) or a close other person (OTHER), and pertaining to either psychological personality traits (INTERNAL) or observable characteristics and behaviors (EXTERNAL). In the ventral medial prefrontal cortex/ventral anterior cingulate cortex, activity was reduced in the autism group across all judgment conditions and also during a resting condition, suggestive of task-independent dysfunction of this region. In other default network regions, overall levels of activity were not different between groups. Furthermore, in several of these regions, we found group by condition interactions only for INTERNAL/EXTERNAL judgments, and not SELF/OTHER judgments, suggestive of task-specific dysfunction. Overall, these results provide a more detailed view of default network functionality and abnormality in autism. © The Author (2008). Published by Oxford University Press.},\n",

      "abstract={Objective: Autistic spectrum disorder (ASD) has been defined as a neurodevelopmental disorder with associated deficits in executive function, language, emotional, and social function. ASD has been associated with pathophysiology in cerebral organization. The current study investigated quantitative EEG findings in twenty children diagnosed with autistic disorders as compared to 20 controls matched for gender, age and IQ. Methods: The EEG was recorded during an eyes-closed resting condition and topographical differences in cerebral functioning were examined using estimates of absolute, relative, and total power, as well as intrahemispheric and interhemispheric coherences. Results: There were group differences in power, intrahemispheric and interhemispheric coherences. Findings included excessive theta, primarily in right posterior regions, in autistics. There was also a pattern of deficient delta over the frontal cortex and excessive midline beta. More significantly, there was a pattern of underconnectivity in autistics compared to controls. This included decreased intrahemispheric delta and theta coherences across short to medium and long inter-electrode distances. Interhemispherically, delta and theta coherences were low across the frontal region. Delta, theta and alpha hypocoherence was also evident over the temporal regions. Lastly, there were low delta, theta and beta coherence measurements across posterior regions. Conclusions: These results suggest dysfunctional integration of frontal and posterior brain regions in autistics along with a pattern of neural underconnectivity. This is consistent with other EEG, MRI and fMRI research suggesting that neural connectivity anomalies are a major deficit leading to autistic symptomatology. Significance: This paper reports the largest integrated study of EEG power and coherence during a resting state in children suffering autism spectrum disorder. © 2008 International Federation of Clinical Neurophysiology.},\n",

      "abstract={In higher functioning individuals with autism, a striking disparity exists between impaired social and emotional abilities and relatively preserved sustained attention and goal-directed cognitive abilities. As these two functional domains appear to map onto two distinct large-scale brain networks, the Task-Negative Network and the Task-Positive Network, respectively, we examined their intrinsically defined functional organization in individuals with autism. Using resting functional connectivity MRI (fcMRI), we found that, in autism, there was altered functional organization of the network involved in social and emotional processing, but no group difference in the functional organization of the network involved in sustained attention and goal-directed cognition. We suggest that these findings might serve to relate the seemingly disparate strengths and weaknesses of the autistic behavioral, perceptual, and cognitive phenotype into a tractable neurofunctional framework.

      "abstract={Brain activation and functional connectivity were investigated in high functioning autism using functional magnetic resonance imaging in an n-back working memory task involving photographic face stimuli. The autism group showed reliably lower activation compared with controls in the inferior left prefrontal area (involved in verbal processing and working memory maintenance) and the right posterior temporal area (associated with theory of mind processing). The participants with autism also showed activation in a somewhat different location in the fusiform area than the control participants. These results suggest that the neural circuitry of the brain for face processing in autism may be analyzing the features of the face more as objects and less in terms of their human significance. The functional connectivity results revealed that the abnormal fusiform activation was embedded in a larger context of smaller and less synchronized networks, particularly indicating lower functional connectivity with frontal areas. In contrast to the underconnectivity with frontal areas, the autism group showed no underconnectivity among posterior cortical regions. These results extend previous findings of abnormal face perception in autism by demonstrating that the abnormalities are embedded in an abnormal cortical network that manages to perform the working memory task proficiently, using a visually oriented, asocial processing style that minimizes reliance on prefrontal areas. © The Author 2007.

      "abstract={Objective: The role of the cerebellum in the pathogenesis of seizures remains controversial. Cerebellar origin of seizures, albeit rare, has been described in the literature in association with intrinsic lesions of the cerebellum. We present a unique case of a patient with medically intractable, secondary generalized epilepsy, associated with a superior cerebellar quadrigeminal arachnoid cyst. Clinical presentation: A 9-year-old child presented with medically refractory secondary generalized epilepsy associated with recurrent headaches since 6 months of age. The child also had moderate intellectual impairment and autism. On the magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the head, he was noticed to have a small superior cerebellar arachnoid cyst in the quadrigeminal area that had increased in size slightly. Interictal electroencephalograph (EEG) was unable to localize the site of the epilepsy. Neurological examination was unremarkable. Intervention: A suboccipital craniotomy and supracerebellar infratentorial approach to the cyst was performed at 9 years of age. Intraoperative electrocorticography (ECOG) demonstrated epileptic activity from the cerebellar tissue adjacent to the cyst. The cyst was fenestrated, and the cyst wall was sent for histology. Seizure control improved dramatically after fenestration of the cyst. Conclusion: This case provides strong evidence that, albeit rare, the cerebellum may be a source of epileptic activity due to compression by a lesion in the posterior fossa. Hence, in cases with intractable epilepsy of unknown supratentorial source, the differential diagnosis should include a posterior fossa lesion. The finding of a posterior fossa lesion in such cases, even if it is small and appears benign, should precipitate a discussion about the possible relationship between the posterior fossa lesion and the epilepsy. © Springer-Verlag 2007.},\n",

      "abstract={A series of recent empirical observations demonstrate structured activity patterns that exist during passive task states. One observation is that a network of regions, referred to as the default network, shows preferentially greater activity during passive task states as compared to a wide range of active tasks. The second observation is that distributed regions spontaneously increase and decrease their activity together within functional-anatomic networks, even under anesthesia. We believe these rest activity patterns may reflect neural functions that consolidate the past, stabilize brain ensembles, and prepare us for the future. Accumulating data further suggest that differences in rest activity may be relevant to understanding clinical conditions such as Alzheimer's disease and autism. Maps of spontaneous network correlations also provide tools for functional localization and study of comparative anatomy between primate species. For all of these reasons, we advocate the systematic exploration of rest activity. © 2007 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},\n",

      "abstract={Human attentional control is unrivaled. We recently proposed that adults depend on distinct frontoparietal and cinguloopercular networks for adaptive online task control versus more stable set control, respectively. During development, both experience-dependent evoked activity and spontaneous waves of synchronized cortical activity are thought to support the formation and maintenance of neural networks. Such mechanisms may encourage tighter \"integration\" of some regions into networks over time while \"segregating\" other sets of regions into separate networks. Here we use resting state functional connectivity MRI, which measures correlations in spontaneous blood oxygenation level-dependent signal fluctuations between brain regions to compare previously identified control networks between children and adults. We find that development of the proposed adult control networks involves both segregation (i.e., decreased short-range connections) and integration (i.e., increased long-range connections) of the brain regions that comprise them. Delay/disruption in the developmental processes of segregation and integration may play a role in disorders of control, such as autism, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, and Tourette's syndrome. © 2007 by The National Academy of Sciences of the USA.},\n",

Results: In the θ (3-6 Hz) frequency range, locally elevated coherence was evident for the ASD group, especially within left hemisphere frontal and temporal regions. In the lower α range (8-10 Hz), globally reduced coherence was evident for the ASD group within frontal regions and between frontal and all other scalp regions. The ASD group exhibited significantly greater relative power between 3 and 6 Hz and 13-17 Hz and significantly less relative power between 9 and 10 Hz.

      "abstract={Background: Inhibiting prepotent responses is critical to optimal cognitive and behavioral function across many domains. Several behavioral studies have investigated response inhibition in autism, and the findings varied according to the components involved in inhibition. There has been only one published functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) study so far on inhibition in autism, which found greater activation in participants with autism than control participants. Methods: This study investigated the neural basis of response inhibition in 12 high-functioning adults with autism and 12 age- and intelligence quotient (IQ)-matched control participants during a simple response inhibition task and an inhibition task involving working memory. Results: In both inhibition tasks, the participants with autism showed less brain activation than control participants in areas often found to be active in response inhibition tasks, namely the anterior cingulate cortex. In the more demanding inhibition condition, involving working memory, the participants with autism showed more activation than control participants in the premotor areas. In addition to the activation differences, the participants with autism showed lower levels of synchronization between the inhibition network (anterior cingulate gyrus, middle cingulate gyrus, and insula) and the right middle and inferior frontal and right inferior parietal regions. Conclusions: The results indicate that the inhibition circuitry in the autism group is activated atypically and is less synchronized, leaving inhibition to be accomplished by strategic control rather than automatically. At the behavioral level, there was no difference between the groups. © 2007 Society of Biological Psychiatry.},\n",

      "abstract={The brain activation of a group of high-functioning autistic participants was measured using functional magnetic resonance imaging during the performance of a Tower of London task, in comparison with a control group matched with respect to intelligent quotient, age, and gender. The 2 groups generally activated the same cortical areas to similar degrees. However, there were 3 indications of underconnectivity in the group with autism. First, the degree of synchronization (i.e., the functional connectivity or the correlation of the time series of the activation) between the frontal and parietal areas of activation was lower for the autistic than the control participants. Second, relevant parts of the corpus callosum, through which many of the bilaterally activated cortical areas communicate, were smaller in cross-sectional area in the autistic participants. Third, within the autism group but not within the control group, the size of the genu of the corpus callosum was correlated with frontal-parietal functional connectivity. These findings suggest that the neural basis of altered cognition in autism entails a lower degree of integration of information across certain cortical areas resulting from reduced intracortical connectivity. The results add support to a new theory of cortical underconnectivity in autism, which posits a deficit in integration of information at the neural and cognitive levels. © The Author 2006.

The preferred treatment for non-malignant catatonia is benzodiazepines, which often produce a reduction in symptoms within 24 hours. Presented here is a case report of a 19-year-old woman appearing in a catatonic state that did not respond to lorazepam. On the basis of emerging evidence that atypical antipsychotics and weak N-Methyl-D-Aspartate (NMDA) receptor-antagonists may effectively treat catatonia, we treated our patient with olanzapine and amantadine, which resulted in a dramatic reduction in her catatonic symptoms. © 2007 The Academy of Psychosomatic Medicine. Indications:1 patient with lorazepam-refractory catatonia. Coexisting disease: autism. Patients:One 19-year-old African American female inpatient. Results:On the following day of Symmetrel and olanzapine treatment, there was dramatic improvement of the patient's catatonic symptoms. She was oriented to person and place, and was able to communicate in longer sentences. Her mutism was remarkably decreased. Stereotypy and verbigeration were no longer present. Although still showing motor perseveration, she stopped these movements on her own after a few seconds. When postured, she slowly brought her arms back to resting position instead of holding them up as she had before. Score on the Bush-Francis Catatonia Rating Scale reduced to 5. AdverseEffects:No adverse events were mentioned. AuthorsConclusions:On the basis of our case report, we propose that further studies testing the treatment of catatonia with both olanzapine and amantadine or monotherapy with olanzapine are warranted. FreeText:The patient presented with altered mental status and abnormal new behaviors. During the past 3 weeks she had been sleeping poorly, had lost urinary continence, showed decreased communication, and was not taking care of herself. She was not oriented to time, person, or place (stereotypy). She exhibited a blunted affect, with speech impairment. Electroencephalogram revealed generalized background disorganization. She had a poor attention span, and showed poor short-term memory. She showed motor perseveration, echophenomena, and verbigeration. When her arms were raised or moved to positions other than resting on the bed, she held that position until her arms were taken and placed back onto the bed (posturing). She showed passive obedience. She was unable to follow instructions for finger-to-nose testing. She had a slightly wide-based gait. She scored a 29 on the Bush-Francis Catatonia Rating Scale. Treatment with lorazepam was ineffective. Symmetrel and olanzapine (5 mg intramuscularly) were given.

      "abstract={The social brain hypothesis is a useful heuristic for understanding schizophrenia. It focuses attention on the core Bleulerian concept of autistic alienation and is consistent with well - replicated findings of social brain in schizophrenia as well as contemporary theories of human cognitive and brain evolution. The contributions of Heidegger, Merlau - Ponty and Wittgenstein allow us to arrive at a new \"philosophy of interpersonal relatedness\", which better reflects the \"embodied mind\" and signifies the end of Cartesian dualistic thinking. In this paper I review the evolution, development and neurobiology of the social brain the anatomical and functional substrate for adaptive social behaviour and cognition. Functional imaging identifies fronto - temporal and fronto - parietal cortical networks as comprising the social brain, while discovery of \"mirror neurons\" provides an understanding of social cognition at a cellular level. Patients with schizophrenia display abnormalities in a wide range of social cognition takes such as emotion recognition, theory of mind and affective responsiveness. Furthermore, recent research indicates that schizophrenia is a disorder of functional and structural connectivity of social brain networks. These findings lend support to the claim that schizophrenia represents a costly by - product of social brain evolution in Homo sapiens. Individuals with this disorder find themselves seriously disadvantaged in the social arena and vulnerable to the stresses of their complex social environments. This state of \"disembodiment\" and interpersonal alienation is the core phenomenon of schizophrenia and the root cause of intolerable suffering in the lives of those affected. © Medicinska Naklada - Zagreb, Croatia.},\n",

Computer animations depict a circle at the bottom of a U-shaped valley rolling up and down its slopes and getting closer to a target resting at the top of either side of the valley. The circle's persistent motion and improving attempts evoke the attribution of the intention to reach the target, regardless of whether the circle fails or attains its goal. Children with autism are as able as controls to infer an agent's intended-goal, disregarding its failure to reach the target. In addition, the study showed that the perception of persistent motion is a sufficient but not a necessary cue for very young children and children with autisn to attribute intention to an agent, whereas adults consider the persistent motion cue as a sufficient and necessary cue to attribute intention to an agent. © 2006 The British Psychological Society.},\n",

      "abstract={Background: Autism is a neurodevelopmental disorder affecting sociocommunicative behavior, but also sensorimotor skill learning, oculomotor control, and executive functioning. Some of these impairments may be related to abnormalities of the caudate nuclei, which have been reported for autism. Methods: Our sample was comprised of 8 high-functioning males with autism and 8 handedness, sex, and age-matched controls. Subjects underwent functional MRI scanning during performance on simple visuomotor coordination tasks. Functional connectivity MRI (fcMRI) effects were identified as interregional blood oxygenation level dependent (BOLD) signal cross-correlation, using the caudate nuclei as seed volumes. Results: In the control group, fcMRI effects were found in circuits with known participation of the caudate nuclei (associative, orbitofrontal, oculomotor, motor circuits). Although in the autism group fcMRI effects within these circuits were less pronounced or absent, autistic subjects showed diffusely increased connectivity mostly in pericentral regions, but also in brain areas outside expected anatomical circuits (such as visual cortex). Conclusion: These atypical connectivity patterns may be linked to developmental brain growth disturbances recently reported in autism and suggest inefficiently organized functional connectivity between caudate nuclei and cerebral cortex, potentially accounting for stereotypic behaviors and executive impairments. © 2006 Turner et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.},\n",

      "abstract={The pathophysiology of autism appears to encompass a number of different brain structures and systems. However, the most consistent site of neural abnormality in autism is the cerebellum. Postmortem investigations have reported a variety of anomalies, most notably a reduction in the number of Purkinje neurons. Additionally, structural neuroimaging studies have shown volumetric changes in the cerebellum, including decreases in gray matter and increases in white matter. Emerging evidence for cerebellar abnormality in autism was paralleled by a revolution in our understanding of normal cerebellar function and cerebellar connectivity, such that the importance of elucidating the contributions of the cerebellum to autism is now clear. In fact, recent brain-behavior correlation studies suggest that cerebellar abnormality may play a more central role in autism than previously thought. At present, it is crucial that we increase our understanding of cerebellar functioning in autism, and functional neuroimaging studies are just beginning to reveal the possible role(s) of cerebellar dysfunction in this disorder. In this review, evidence for cerebellar anatomic and functional abnormality in autism will be delineated. This will be followed by consideration of the implications of cerebellar abnormality in autism. Two major questions will be addressed: (1) how might dysfunction of the cerebellum impact the development of connectivity between the cerebellum and other brain systems, and (2) how might cerebellar dysfunction impact behavior and the symptoms of autism. The paper concludes with a discussion of how cerebellar abnormalities might inform our understanding of the etiology of autism spectrum disorders. © 2006 Association for Research in Nervous and Mental Disease.},\n",

Conclusion: The study suggests some inte resting insights and confirms the need for more attention to this area. A key question raised by the study is how a child-focused multidisciplinary team can embrace its role in delivering a family-centred service. The clinical implications of this project have led to a change of practice in the specialist team. Further research would be appropriate to investigate the therapeutic effectiveness and cost effectiveness of involving grandparents as part of the assessment process. © 2006 The Authors; Journal compilation © 2006 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.},\n",

      "abstract={Based on evidence for thalamic abnormalities in autism, impairments of thalamocortical pathways have been suspected. We examined the functional connectivity between thalamus and cerebral cortex in terms of blood oxygen level dependent (BOLD) signal cross-correlation in 8 male participants with high-functioning autism and matched normal controls, using functional MRI during simple visuomotor coordination. Both groups exhibited widespread connectivity, consistent with known extensive thalamocortical connectivity. In a direct group comparison, overall more extensive connectivity was observed in the autism group, especially in the left insula and in right postcentral and middle frontal regions. Our findings are inconsistent with the hypothesis of general underconnectivity in autism and instead suggest that subcortico-cortical connectivity may be hyperfunctional, potentially compensating for reduced cortico-cortical connectivity. © 2006 Elsevier B.V.

Sixteen individuals with ASD and 16 matched control participants completed a task in which pairs of face and house stimuli were present on every trial, with one of the pairs randomly assigned to attended locations and the other to unattended locations. Both mass-univariate (SPM) and region of interest analyses suggested that responses to houses were modulated by attention in both groups, but that only the control participants demonstrated attentional modulation of face-selective regions. Thus, the participants with ASD demonstrated a lack of attentional modulation which was particularly evident for the social stimulus. Analyses of effective connectivity indicated that these results were due to a failure of attention to modulate connectivity between extrastriate areas and V1. We discuss how these results may suggest a mechanism to explain the reduced salience of social stimuli in ASD. © 2006 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},\n",

      "abstract={Autism is a neurodevelopmental disorder with a range of clinical presentations. These presentations vary from mild to severe and are referred to as autism spectrum disorders. The most common clinical sign of autism spectrum disorders is social interaction impairment, which is associated with verbal and non-verbal communication deficits and stereotyped and repetitive behaviors. Thanks to recent brain imaging studies, scientists are getting a better idea of the neural circuits involved in autism spectrum disorders. Indeed, functional brain imaging, such as positron emission tomography, single foton emission tomographyand functional MRI have opened a new perspective to study normal and pathological brain functioning. Three independent studies have found anatomical and rest functional temporal lobe abnormalities in autistic patients. These alterations are localized in the superior temporal sulcus bilaterally, an area which is critical for perception of key social stimuli. In addition, functional studies have shown hypoactivation of most areas implicated in social perception (face and voice perception) and social cognition (theory of mind). These data suggest an abnormal functioning of the social brain network in autism. The understanding of the functional alterations of this important mechanism may drive the elaboration of new and more adequate social re-educative strategies for autistic patients.},\n",

      "abstract={Several regions of the brain (including medial prefrontal cortex, rostral anterior cingulate, posterior cingulate, and precuneus) are known to have high metabolic activity during rest, which is suppressed during cognitively demanding tasks. With functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), this suppression of activity is observed as \"deactivations,\" which are thought to be indicative of an interruption of the mental activity that persists during rest. Thus, measuring deactivation provides a means by which rest-associated functional activity can be quantitatively examined. Applying this approach to autism, we found that the autism group failed to demonstrate this deactivation effect. Furthermore, there was a strong correlation between a clinical measure of social impairment and functional activity within the ventral medial prefrontal cortex. We speculate that the lack of deactivation in the autism group is indicative of abnormal internally directed processes at rest, which may be an important contribution to the social and emotional deficits of autism. © 2006 by The National Academy of Sciences of the USA.},\n",

      "abstract={Comprehending high-imagery sentences like The number eight when rotated 90 degrees looks like a pair of eyeglasses involves the participation and integration of several cortical regions. The linguistic content must be processed to determine what is to be mentally imaged, and then the mental image must be evaluated and related to the sentence. A theory of cortical underconnectivity in autism predicts that the interregional collaboration required between linguistic and imaginal processing in this task would be underserved in autism. This functional MRI study examined brain activation in 12 participants with autism and 13 age- and IQ-matched control participants while they processed sentences with either high- or low-imagery content. The analysis of functional connectivity among cortical regions showed that the language and spatial centres in the participants with autism were not as well synchronized as in controls. In addition to the functional connectivity differences, there was also a group difference in activation. In the processing of low-imagery sentences (e.g. Addition, subtraction and multiplication are all math skills), the use of imagery is not essential to comprehension. Nevertheless, the autism group activated parietal and occipital brain regions associated with imagery for comprehending both the low and high-imagery sentences, suggesting that they were using mental imagery in both conditions. In contrast, the control group showed imagery-related activation primarily in the high-imagery condition. The findings provide further evidence of underintegration of language and imagery in autism (and hence expand the understanding of underconnectivity) but also show that people with autism are more reliant on visualization to support language comprehension. © The Author (2006).

The aim of this study was to measure baseline cardiovascular autonomic function in children with autism using the NeuroScope, a device that can measure this brainstem function in real-time. Resting cardiac vagal tone (CVT), cardiac sensitivity to baroreflex (CSB), mean arterial blood pressure (MAP), diastolic blood pressure (DBP), systolic blood pressure (SBP) and heart rate (HR) were recorded in three different groups of children. The symptomatic group (n=15) consisted of those with autism who exhibited symptoms or signs of autonomic dysfunction. The asymptomatic group (n=13) consisted of children with autism but without symptoms or signs of autonomic dysfunction and the healthy children were in the control group (n=117). The CVT and CSB were significantly lower in association with a significant elevation in HR, MAP and DBP in all children with autism compared with the healthy controls. Further more, the levels of CVT and CSB were lower in the symptomatic than in the asymptomatic group. The levels of CVT and CSB were not related to age in all the three groups. These results suggest that there is low baseline cardiac parasympathetic activity with evidence of elevated sympathetic tone in children with autism whether or not they have symptoms or signs of autonomic abnormalities. © 2005 Elsevier B.V.

      "abstract={Autistic symptoms begin in the first years of life, and recent magnetic resonance imaging studies have discovered brain growth abnormalities that precede and overlap with the onset of these symptoms. Recent postmortem studies of the autistic brain provide evidence of cellular abnormalities and processes that may underlie the recently discovered early brain overgrowth and arrest of growth that marks the first years of life in autism. Alternative origins and time tables for these cellular defects and processes are discussed. These cellular and growth abnormalities are most pronounced in frontal, cerebellar, and temporal structures that normally mediate the development of those same higher order social, emotional, speech, language, speech, attention, and cognitive functions that characterize autism. Cellular and growth pathologies are milder and perhaps nonexistent in other structures (e.g., occipital cortex), which are known to mediate functions that are often either mildly affected or entirely unaffected in autistic patients. It is argued that in autism, higher order functions largely fail to develop normally in the first place because frontal, cerebellar, and temporal cellular and growth pathologies occur prior to and during the critical period when these higher order neural systems first begin to form their circuitry. It is hypothesized that microstructural maldevelopment results in local and short distance overconnectivity in frontal cortex that is largely ineffective and in a failure of long-distance cortical-cortical coupling, and thus a reduction in frontal-posterior reciprocal connectivity. This altered circuitry impairs the essential role of frontal cortex in integrating information from diverse functional systems (emotional, sensory, autonomic, memory, etc.) and providing context-based and goal-directed feedback to lower level systems.

Thirteen high-functioning individuals with Asperger's syndrome and 13 healthy volunteers were scanned during incidental processing of fearful facial expressions. Results: Using permutation tests for inference, we found evidence for significant abnormality of functional integration of amygdala and parahippocampal gyrus (p <. 05, false discovery rate [FDR] corrected) in people with Asperger's syndrome. There were less salient abnormalities in functional connectivity of anterior cingulate, inferior occipital, and inferior frontal cortex, but there was no significant difference between groups in whole brain functional connectivity.

The current study investigates functional connectivity along the dorsal stream in autism, examining interregional blood oxygenation level dependent (BOLD) signal cross-correlation during visuomotor coordination. Eight high-functioning autistic men and eight handedness and age-matched controls were included. Visually prompted button presses were performed with the preferred hand. For each subject, functional connectivity was computed in terms of BOLD signal correlation with the mean time series in bilateral visual area 17. Our hypothesis of reduced dorsal stream connectivity in autism was only in part confirmed. Functional connectivity with superior parietal areas was not significantly reduced. However, the autism group showed significantly reduced connectivity with bilateral inferior frontal area 44, which is compatible with the hypothesis of mirror neuron defects in autism.

      "abstract={Autism is a disorder of neurodevelopment resulting in pervasive abnormalities in social interaction and communication, repetitive behaviours and restricted interests. There is evidence for functional abnormalities and metabolic dysconnectivity in 'social brain' circuitry in this condition, but its structural basis has proved difficult to establish reliably. Explanations for this include replication difficulties inherent in 'region of interest' approaches usually adopted, and variable inclusion criteria for subjects across the autism spectrum. Moreover, despite a consensus that autism probably affects widely distributed brain regions, the issue of anatomical connectivity has received little attention. Therefore, we planned a fully automated voxel-based whole brain volumetric analysis in children with autism and normal IQ. We predicted that brain structural changes would be similar to those previously shown in adults with autism spectrum disorder and that a correlation analysis would suggest structural dysconnectivity. We included 17 stringently diagnosed children with autism and 17 age-matched controls. All children had IQ >80. Using Brain Activation and Morphological Mapping (BAMM) software, we measured global brain and tissue class volumes and mapped regional grey and white matter differences across the whole brain. With the expectation that volumes of interconnected regions correlate positively, we carried out a preliminary exploration of 'connectivity' in autism by comparing the nature of interregional grey matter volume correlations with control. Children with autism had a significant reduction in total grey matter volume and significant increase in CSF volume. They had significant localized grey matter reductions within fronto-striatal and parietal networks similar to findings in our previous study, and additional decreases in ventral and superior temporal grey matter. White matter was reduced in the cerebellum, left internal capsule and fornices. Correlation analysis revealed significantly more numerous and more positive grey matter volumetric correlations in controls compared with children with autism. Thus, using similar diagnostic criteria and image analysis methods in otherwise healthy populations with an autistic spectrum disorder from different countries, cultures and age groups, we report a number of consistent findings. Taken together, our data suggest abnormalities in the anatomy and connectivity of limbic-striatal 'social' brain systems which may contribute to the brain metabolic differences and behavioural phenotype in autism.},\n",

      "abstract={Background: Psychophysiological measurement of processes related to social behavior may be valuable for research on individual differences and subgroups among children with autism spectrum disorders (Coleman, 1987; Dawson, Klinger, Panagiotides, Lewy, & Castelloe, 1995; Modahl et al., 1998). In particular, recent research and theory suggests that measures of resting anterior EEG asymmetry reflect complex brain processes associated with individual differences in approach or avoidance motivation that may be associated with social and emotional interaction tendencies among children with autism. Method: This hypothesis was examined in a study of the relations among resting anterior asymmetry, social impairment, and social anxiety in 23 high functioning children with autism (HFA) and 20 controls (age range 9-14 years). Results: These groups were significantly different on the measures of anterior asymmetry, social symptoms and anxiety-related measures. Moreover, HFA children who displayed right frontal asymmetry (RFA group) displayed more symptoms of social impairments and better visual analytic skills than did children who displayed left frontal asymmetry (LFA group). Alternatively, while the LFA group displayed fewer symptoms of social impairment they also reported greater levels of social anxiety, social stress, and lower satisfaction with interpersonal relations than did the RFA group. Conclusions: These observations indicate that anterior EEG asymmetry may be a marker of motivation and emotion processes that refract the autism taxon into important individual differences in social presentation among higher functioning children. © Association for Child Psychology and Psychiatry, 2004.},\n",

      "abstract={The underlying neurobiology of autism, a severe pervasive developmental disorder, remains unknown. Few neocortical brain MRI abnormalities have been reported. Using rest functional brain imaging, two independent studies have described localized bilateral temporal hypoperfusion in children with primary autism. In order to search for convergent evidence of anatomical abnormalities in autistic children, we performed an anatomical MRI study using optimized whole-brain voxel-based morphometry (VBM). High-resolution 3-D T1-weighted MRI data sets were acquired in 21 children with primary autism (mean age 9.3 ± 2.2 years) and 12 healthy control children (mean age 10.8 ± 2.7 years). By comparing autistic children to normal children, we found bilaterally significant decreases of grey matter concentration located in superior temporal sulcus (STS) (P < 0.05 corrected, after small volume correction; SVC). Children with autism were also found to have a decrease of white matter concentration located in the right temporal pole and in cerebellum (P < 0.05, corrected) compared to normal children. These results suggest that autism is associated with bilateral anatomical abnormalities localized in the STS and are remarkably consistent with functional hypoperfusion previously reported in children with autism. The multimodal STS areas are involved in highest level of cortical integration of both sensory and limbic information. Moreover, the STS is now recognized as a key cortical area of the \"social brain\" and is implicated in social perceptual skills that are characteristically impaired in autism. Therefore, the convergent anatomical and functional temporal abnormalities observed in autism may be important in the understanding of brain behavior relationships in this severe developmental disorder. © 2004 Elsevier Inc.

      "abstract={Autism is a neurodevelopmental disorder affecting behavioral and social cognition, but there is little understanding about the link between the functional deficit and its underlying neuroanatomy. We applied a 2D version of voxel-based morphometry (VBM) in differentiating the white matter concentration of the corpus callosum for the group of 16 high functioning autistic and 12 normal subjects. Using the white matter density as an index for neural connectivity, autism is shown to exhibit less white matter concentration in the region of the genu, rostrum, and splenium removing the effect of age based on the general linear model (GLM) framework. Further, it is shown that the less white matter concentration in the corpus callosum in autism is due to hypoplasia rather than atrophy. © 2004 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},\n",

      "abstract={The brain activation of a group of high-functioning autistic participants was measured using functional MRI during sentence comprehension and the results compared with those of a Verbal IQ-matched control group. The groups differed in the distribution of activation in two of the key language areas. The autism group produced reliably more activation than the control group in Wernicke's (left latero-superior temporal) area and reliably less activation than the control group in Broca's (left inferior frontal gyrus) area. Furthermore, the functional connectivity, i.e. the degree of synchronization or correlation of the time series of the activation, between the various participating cortical areas was consistently lower for the autistic than the control participants. These findings suggest that the neural basis of disordered language in autism entails a lower degree of information integration and synchronization across the large-scale cortical network for language processing. The article presents a theoretical account of the findings, related to neurobiological foundations of underconnectivity in autism.},\n",

      "abstract={The recent suggestion that secretin may be useful in treating autism and schizophrenia has begun to focus attention on the mechanisms underlying this gut-brain peptide's actions in the central nervous system (CNS). In vitro autoradiographic localization of 125I-secretin binding sites in rat brain shows the highest binding density in the nucleus tractus solitarius (NTS). Recent evidence suggests that intravenous infusion of secretin causes fos activation in NTS, a relay station playing important roles in the central regulation of autonomic functions. In this study, whole cell patch-clamp recordings were obtained from 127 NTS neurons in rat medullary slices. The mean resting membrane potential of these neurons was -54.7 ± 0.3 mV, the mean input resistance was 3.7 ± 0.2 GΩ, and the action potential amplitude of these neurons was always &gt;70 mV. Current-clamp studies showed that bath application of secretin depolarized the majority (80.8%; 42/52) of NTS neurons tested, whereas the remaining cells were either unaffected (17.3%; 9/52) or hyperpolarized (1.9%; 1/52). These depolarizing effects were maintained in the presence of 5 μM TTX and found to be concentration dependent from 10-12 to 10-7 M. Using voltage-clamp techniques, we also identified modulatory actions of secretin on specific ion channels. Our results demonstrate that while secretin is without effect on net whole cell potassium currents, it activates a nonselective cationic conductance (NSCC). These results show that NTS neurons are activated by secretin as a consequence of activation of a NSCC and support the emerging view that secretin can act as a neuropeptide within the CNS.},\n",

      "abstract={Increased brain volume in autism appears to be driven mainly by an unexplained white matter enlargement, and we have reported a similar phenomenon in developmental language disorder (DLD). Localization of this enlargement would strongly guide research into its cause, tissue basis, and functional implications. We utilized a white matter parcellation technique that divides cerebral white matter into an outer zone containing the radiate compartment and an inner zone containing sagittal and bridging system compartments. In both high-functioning autism and DLD, enlargement localized to the radiate white matter (all lobes in autism, all but parietal in DLD), whereas inner zone white matter compartments showed no volume differences from controls. Furthermore, in both autism and DLD, later or longer-myelinating regions showed greater volume increases over controls. Neither group showed cerebral cortex, corpus callosum, or internal capsule volume differences from control. Radiate white matter myelinates later than deep white matter; this pattern of enlargement thus is consistent with striking postnatal head circumference percentile increases reported in autism. These findings suggest an ongoing postnatal process in both autism and DLD that is probably intrinsic to white matter, that primarily affects intrahemispheric and corticocortical connections, and that places these two disorders on the same spectrum.},\n",

When examined individually, parasympathetic function was suppressed in all subjects in the control group. On the other hand, parasympathetic function was activated in half of the autistic subjects. The paradoxical autonomic response suggests that some autistic subjects were more stressed under 'resting' conditions than while performing mechanical or repetitive mental tasks. The results seem to support autonomic hyperarousal in some people with autism.},\n",

      "abstract={Objective: Recent years have seen a revolution in views regarding cerebellar function. New findings suggest that the cerebellum plays a role in multiple functional domains: cognitive, affective, and sensory as well as motor. These findings imply that developmental cerebellar pathology could play a role in certain nonmotor functional deficits, thereby calling for a broader investigation of the functional consequences of cerebellar pathology. Autism provides a useful model, since over 90% of autistic cerebella examined at autopsy have shown well-defined cerebellar anatomic abnormalities. The aim of the present study was to examine how such pathology ultimately impacts cognitive and motor function within the cerebellum. Method: Patterns of functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) activation within anatomically defined cerebellar regions of interest were examined in eight autistic patients (ages 14-38 years) and eight matched healthy comparison subjects performing motor and attention tasks. For the motor task, subjects pressed a button at a comfortable pace, and activation was compared with a rest condition. For the attention task, visual stimuli were presented one at a time at fixation, and subjects pressed a button to every target. Activation was compared with passive visual stimulation. Results: While performing these tasks, autistic individuals showed significantly greater cerebellar motor activation and significantly less cerebellar attention activation. Conclusions: These findings shed new light on the cerebellar role in attention deficits in autism and suggest that developmental cerebellar abnormality has differential functional implications for cognitive and motor systems.},\n",

      "abstract={Childhood autism is now widely viewed as being of developmental neurobiological origin. Yet, localized structural and functional brain correlates of autism have yet to be established. Structural brain imaging studies performed in autistic patients have reported abnormalities such as increased total brain volume and cerebellar abnormalities. However, none of these abnormalities fully account for the full range of autistic symptoms. Functional brain imaging, such as positron emission tomography (PET), single positron emission tomography (SPECT) and functional MRI (fMRI) have opened a new perspective to study normal an pathological brain functions. In autism, functional studies were performed at rest or during activation. However, the first generation of the functional imaging devices were not sensitive enough to detect any consistent dysfunction. Recently, with improved technology, two independent groups have reported in autistic children a bilateral hypoperfusion located in the temporal lobes. In addition, activation studies, using perceptive and cognitive paradigms, have shown an abnormal pattern of cortical activation in autistic patients. These results suggest that different connections between particular cortical regions could exist in autism. The purpose of this review is to present the main results of rest and activation studies performed in autism.},\n",

      "abstract={Ten able adults with autism or Asperger syndrome and 10 normal volunteers were PET scanned while watching animated sequences. The animations depicted two triangles moving about on a screen in three different conditions: moving randomly, moving in a goal-directed fashion (chasing, fighting), and moving interactively with implied intentions (coaxing, tricking). The last condition frequently elicited descriptions in terms of mental states that viewers attributed to the triangles (mentalizing). The autism group gave fewer and less accurate descriptions of these latter animations, but equally accurate descriptions of the other animations compared with controls. While viewing animations that elicited mentalizing, in contrast to randomly moving shapes, the normal group showed increased activation in a previously identified mentalizing network (medial prefrontal cortex, superior temporal sulcus at the temporoparietal junction and temporal poles). The autism group showed less activation than the normal group in all these regions. However, one additional region, extrastriate cortex, which was highly active when watching animations that elicited mentalizing, showed the same amount of increased activation in both groups. In the autism group this extrastriate region showed reduced functional connectivity with the superior temporal sulcus at the temporo-parietal junction, an area associated with the processing of biological motion as well as with mentalizing. This finding suggests a physiological cause for the mentalizing dysfunction in autism: a bottleneck in the interaction between higher order and lower order perceptual processes.},\n",

      "abstract={To understand the implications of suboptimal gene expression in fragile X syndrome [fra(X)], we sought to define the central nervous abnormalities in fra(X) syndrome to determine if abnormalities in specific brain regions or networks might explain the cognitive and behavioral abnormalities in this syndrome. Cranial and ventricular volumes were measured with quantitative computed tomography (CT), regional cerebral metabolic rates for glucose (rCMRglc) were measured with [18-F]-2-fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose (18FDG), and patterns of cognition were determined with neuropsychological testing in ten healthy, male patients with karyotypically proven fra(X) syndrome (age range 20-30 yr). Controls for the CT studies were 20 healthy males (age range 21- 37 yr), controls for the PET studies were 9 healthy males (age range 22-31 yr), and controls for the neuropsychological tests were 10 young adult, male Down syndrome (DS) subjects (age range 22-31 yr). The mean mental age of the fra(X) syndrome group was 5.3 yr (range 3.5-7.5 yr; Stanford-Binet Intelligence Scale). Despite comparable levels of mental retardation, the fra(X) subjects showed poorer attention/short term memory in comparison to the DS group. Further, the fra(X) subjects showed a relative strength in verbal compared to visuospatial attention/short term memory. As measured with quantitative CT, 8 fra(X) subjects had a significant (P &lt; 0.05) 12% greater intracranial volume (1,410 ± 86 cm3) as compared to controls(1,254 ± 122 cm3). Volumes of the right and left lateral ventricles and the third ventricle did not differ between groups. Seven of eight patients had greater right lateral ventricle volumes than left, as opposed to 9 out of 20 controls (P &lt; 0.05). Global gray matter CMR-glc in nine fra(X) patients was 9.79 ± 1.28 mg/100 g/minute and did not differ from 8.84 ± 1.31 mg/100 g/minute in the controls. R/L asymmetry in metabolism of the superior parietal lobe was significantly higher in the patients than controls. A preliminary principal component analysis of metabolic data showed that the fra(X) subjects tended to form a separate subgroup that is characterized by relative elevation of normalized metabolism in the lenticular nucleus, thalamus, and premotor regions. Further, a discriminant function, that reflected rCMRglc interactions of the right lenticular and left premotor regions, distinguished the fra(X) subjects from controls. These regions are part of a major group of functionally and anatomically related brain regions and appear disturbed as well in autism with which fra(X) has distinct behavioral similarities. These results show a cognitive profile in fra(X) syndrome that is distinct from that of Down syndrome, that the larger brains in fragile X syndrome are not accompanied by generalized cerebral cortical atrophy or hypoplasia, and that distinctive alterations in resting regional glucose metabolism, measured with 18 FDG and PET, occur in fra(X) syndrome.},\n",

The patients had not been treated with neuroleptics for at least 3 weeks before the first study. All suffered from acute psychotic symptoms and were hospitalized to obtain neuroleptic treatment. After determination of regional brain metabolism without neuroleptic treatment, 11 patients were treated with sulpiride (800 mg/day) and 6 patients were treated with chlorpromazine (400 mg/day) over 5-6 weeks before the second PET investigation. The control group consisted of seven healthy male volunteers, also investigated twice 5 weeks apart. The PET investigation was made with the subject in a resting state. The tracer was uniformly labelled 11C-glucose. The metabolism was determined bilaterally in 15 brain regions cortical, as well as central regions. Metabolic rates differed among the groups. The sulpiride group had lower metabolic rates than the controls and the schizophrenic patients later treated with chlorpromazine. The sulpiride group, in which absolute metabolic rates were determined, were clinically more autistic and chronic than the chlorpromazine group. It was proposed that these facts could explain the lower metabolic rates in the sulpiride group. A significant change in metabolism in relation to drug treatment was only found in one brain region. The selective D2-receptor antagonist sulpiride increased the metabolic rate in the right lentiform nucleus in comparison with the patients treated with chlorpromazine and the controls. Likewise, relative metabolic rates were increased only in the right lentiform nucleus. Negative correlations between intensity of clinical symptoms and metabolism indicated that emotional tone and drive were related to brain metabolism. No correlations were found between drug concentrations and metabolism or clinical symptoms. © 1989 Springer-Verlag.},\n",

      "abstract={Under the pathological conditions, the VEP may show changes in amplitude, latency, or waveform in one or more of its components. The major advantage of the pattern reversal VEP over the flash VEP lies in smaller variability in the waveform and latency of its components in the healthy population. The flash VEP is, however, particularly useful to infants and newborns. The variation in the waveform of the flash VEP was evaluated, and Type V (Fig. 1) was abnormal waveform. Subsequently, patients with various CNS diseases were examined. Acute hemiplegic patients showed high amplitude or increased latency patterns. In 45 percent of the West syndrome cases, VEP showed abnormal responses. The patients with asphyxia, respiratory distress syndrome and mental retardation showed increased latency. Latency was decreased in hypoglycemia and hypocalcemia of newborns, and it was increased or decreased in autism and epilepsy. In our study, it was concluded that the rhythmic after-discharge is a true response. This assumption is supported by the following observations: (1) the of discharge of VEP appeared before the occurrence fo the alpha-wave in EEG; (2) the frequency of the after-discharge was generally higher than that in EEG and; (3) the frequency of the after-discharge did not change between the conditions of the resting state and hyperventilation. There was no after- dischage in VEP in patients with a history of encephalitis even when their IQs were normal, and the latency was increased in pattern reversal VEP. © 1989, The Japanese Society of Child Neurology.

The autistic children had elevated heart rate, indicating increased autonomic nervous system activity, and failed to show cardiovascular changes in sensory intake.

      "abstract={A typical case of post traumatic dementia, of Alzheimer's disease, and of chronic schizophrenic deterioration were studied with a multidetector technique, to obtain quantitative measurements of the regional cerebral blood flow as an index of the level of functional activity in 32 regions of the hemisphere. Measurements were made at rest and during various forms of sensorimotor and mental activation. In the 2 cases with organic dementia, a reduced mean flow level was recorded, and regional abnormalities were seen which corresponded to the focal injury in the post traumatic case. During activation, marked deviations from normal patterns were seen. In the long term, deteriorated catatonic patient with chronic schizophrenia, the resting flow level was almost normal and activation procedures gave clear cut rCBF patterns of a normal type. These findings contrasted sharply with the autistic and reactionless behavior of the patient during the measurement. It is pointed out that in other elderly schizophrenic patients with advanced deterioration it has not always been possible to elicit similar rCBF patterns.},\n",
